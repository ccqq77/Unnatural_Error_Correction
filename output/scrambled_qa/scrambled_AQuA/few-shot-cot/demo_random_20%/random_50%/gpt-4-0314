In this time, the angle of elevation changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. Using the tangent function, we can write the following equations:\n\ntan(45\u00b0) = h / x\ntan(60\u00b0) = h / (x - d)\n\nwhere h is the height of the tower and d is the distance the car needs to travel to reach the base of the tower.\n\nSince tan(45\u00b0) = 1, we have h = x. Also, tan(60\u00b0) = \u221a3, so h = (x - d)\u221a3. Substituting h = x, we get x = (x - d)\u221a3. Dividing both sides by x, we get 1 = (\u221a3 - d\u221a3/x). Solving for d, we get d = x(1 - 1/\u221a3).\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for the car to travel this distance. Since the car travels x in 10 minutes, it travels d in 10(1 - 1/\u221a3) minutes. Simplifying, we get the time as 10(\u221a3 - 1) minutes.

Since the airplane is flying along the four sides of a square, the total distance is the same for each side. Let's call the side length of the square x. Then the total distance is 4x.\n\nNow we need to find the total time. The time it takes to fly along each side is the distance (x) divided by the speed. So the total time is x/200 + x/400 + x/600 + x/800.\n\nNow we can find the average speed: (4x) / (x/200 + x/400 + x/600 + x/800). To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 2400 (the least common multiple of 200, 400, 600, and 800):\n\n(4x * 2400) / (x/200 * 2400 + x/400 * 2400 + x/600 * 2400 + x/800 * 2400) = (9600x) / (12x + 6x + 4x + 3x) = 9600 / 25 = 384.\n\nSo the average speed of the airplane is 384 km/hr.

Since the ages are in arithmetic progression, the sum of the ages can be represented as Sn = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where a is the age of the youngest member (7 years) and d is the common difference (3 months or 0.25 years). We are given that Sn = 250.\n\nSo, 250 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.25). Simplifying this equation, we get 500 = n * (14 + 0.25n - 0.25). Further simplification gives 500 = 14n + 0.25n^2 - 0.25n. Rearranging the terms, we get 0.25n^2 - 13.75n + 500 = 0.\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation for n. Using the quadratic formula, n = (-(-13.75) \u00b1 \u221a((-13.75)^2 - 4*0.25*500)) / (2*0.25). This gives us n \u2248 20 or n \u2248 25.\n\nSince the number of members must be a whole number, the possible values for n are 20 or 25. We can test both values to see which one satisfies the given conditions.\n\nIf n = 20, then the sum of the ages would be 20/2 * (2*7 + (20-1)*0.25) = 20/2 * (14 + 4.75) = 10 * 18.75 = 187.5, which is not equal to 250.\n\nIf n = 25, then the sum of the ages would be 25/2 * (2*7 + (25-1)*0.25) = 25/2 * (14 + 6) = 12.5 * 20 = 250, which is equal to 250.\n\nTherefore, the number of members in the club is 25.

The total cost of the gift remains the same, so each of the remaining men would have to contribute D/(M-3). The additional amount each man has to contribute is D/(M-3) - D/M. To find this, we can find a common denominator and simplify:\n\nD/(M-3) - D/M = DM/(M(M-3)) - D(M-3)/(M(M-3)) = (DM - D(M-3))/(M(M-3)) = 3D/(M^2 - 3M)\n\nSo the additional amount each man has to contribute is 3D/(M^2 - 3M).

We are given that x^2 - y^2 = 256000 and x + y = 1000. We can rewrite the first equation as (x + y)(x - y) = 256000. Since x + y = 1000, we have 1000(x - y) = 256000. Dividing both sides by 1000, we get x - y = 256. Now we have a system of equations:\n\nx + y = 1000\nx - y = 256\n\nAdding the two equations, we get 2x = 1256, so x = 628.

The area of the walls would be the semi-perimeter times the height, which is 2x * 5x = 10x^2. Since 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows, the actual area to be papered is 10x^2 - 15.\n\nThe cost to paper the walls is Rs.260, and the paper is Rs.2 per meter. Since the paper is 50cm wide, each meter of paper covers 0.5 sq.m. So, 260 / 2 = 130 meters of paper are needed, which covers 130 * 0.5 = 65 sq.m.\n\nTherefore, 10x^2 - 15 = 65, which means 10x^2 = 80. Solving for x, we get x = 2.

In this case, a = 1, b = m, and c = 22. Since one root is 1.5, let the other root be r. Then, the sum of the roots is 1.5 + r = -m/1 = -m, and the product of the roots is 1.5 * r = 22/1 = 22. Solving for r, we get r = 22/1.5 = 14.67 (approximately). Now, we can find the value of m: -m = 1.5 + 14.67 = 16.17 (approximately). Therefore, m = -16.17 (approximately).

When they meet for the first time, the sum of the distances they have traveled is D. Since their speeds are in the ratio 54:78, the distance they have traveled is also in the same ratio. So, Allen has traveled 54D/(54+78) = 54D/132 = 9D/22 km, and Bob has traveled 13D/22 km.\n\nNow, Allen has to travel (13D/22 - 9D/22) = 4D/22 = 2D/11 km more to reach Y, and Bob has to travel (9D/22) km more to reach X. Since Allen's speed is 54 kmph and Bob's speed is 78 kmph, the time taken for Allen to reach Y is (2D/11)/54 = D/297 hours, and the time taken for Bob to reach X is (9D/22)/78 = D/572 hours.\n\nWhen they meet for the second time, Allen has traveled D + 2D/11 = 13D/11 km, and Bob has traveled D + 9D/22 = 31D/22 km. The difference in the distances they have traveled is 48 km, so (31D/22) - (13D/11) = 48.

Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to that of silver, there are 15 cubic mm of aluminum and 15 cubic mm of silver. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of the aluminum is 10 grams and the weight of the silver is 20 grams. \n\nNow, we want to find the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum. The volume of this coin is 1 * 30 = 30 cubic mm, which is the same as the volume of aluminum in the original coin. Since the weight of the aluminum in the original coin is 10 grams, the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum would also be 10 grams.

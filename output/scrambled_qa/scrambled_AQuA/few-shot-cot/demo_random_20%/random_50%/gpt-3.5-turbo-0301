The top fo the tower si observed from the car dna, in the cspreso, ti takes 10 minutes ofr eht elang of elevation ot gachne ofmr 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0.

Then we have:\n\ntan(60\u00b0) = h / x\ntan(45\u00b0) = (h + d) / x\n\nwhere d is the distance from the base of the tower to the point where the car first sees the top of the tower at an angle of 45\u00b0. Solving for h and d, we get:\n\nh = x * \u221a3\nd = x * (\u221a3 + 1)\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the car is traveling at a uniform speed to set up the equation:\n\nx / v = 10 minutes = 1/6 hour\n\nwhere v is the speed of the car. Solving for x, we get:\n\nx = v / 6\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for d, we get:\n\nd = v * (\u221a3 + 1) / 6\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance traveled by the car when it reaches the base of the tower:\n\nx^2 + (h + d)^2 = (v/6)^2\n\nSubstituting in the values we found for h and d, we get:\n\nx^2 + (x * \u221a3 + v * (\u221a3 + 1) / 6)^2 = v^2 / 36\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get a quadratic equation in v:\n\n13v^2 - 72\u221a3vx - 27x^2 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nv = (36\u221a3x) / 13 or v = (-36\u221a3x) / 13\n\nThe negative solution doesn't make sense in this context, so we take the positive solution. Substituting this back into the equation for d, we get:\n\nd = 2x * (\u221a3 + 1)\n\nSo the total distance traveled by the car is:\n\nx + d = 3x * (\u221a3 + 1)\n\nSubstituting in the value we found for x, we get:\n\n3v / (\u221a3 + 1) = 2v\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nv = 3(\u221a3 + 1)\n\nNow, we can find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower:\n\nx / v = (v / 6) / v = 1 / 18 hour\n\nConverting to minutes, we get:\n\n1 / 18 * 60 = 10/3 minutes\n\nSo the answer is (E) None of these, since none of the given choices match this value.", "pred_strict": "E", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "A"}

We know that this percentage is 2% higher than the percentage of non-defective staplers that were rejected by mistake. Let y be the number of non-defective staplers. Then the percentage of non-defective staplers that were rejected by mistake is 72/y * 100%. We can set up the equation:\n\n10/x * 100% = 72/y * 100% + 2%\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n10/x = 72/y + 0.02\n\nMultiplying both sides by xy, we get:\n\n10y = 72x + 0.02xy\n\nWe also know that the total number of staplers produced is x + y. We can set up another equation using this information:\n\nx + y = total number of staplers\n\nWe want to find the value of x, which represents the number of staplers that were defective. We can solve for y in the second equation and substitute it into the first equation:\n\ny = total number of staplers - x\n\nSubstituting into the first equation:\n\n10/x * 100% = 72/(total number of staplers - x) * 100% + 2%\n\nMultiplying both sides by x and simplifying:\n\n1000 = 72x/(total number of staplers - x) + 0.02x\n\nMultiplying both sides by (total number of staplers - x) and simplifying:\n\n1000(total number of staplers - x) = 72x + 0.02x(total number of staplers - x)\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n1000total number of staplers - 1000x = 72x + 0.02x total number of staplers - 0.02x^2\n\nRearranging and simplifying:\n\n0.02x^2 - 928x + 1000total number of staplers = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [928 \u00b1 sqrt(928^2 - 4(0.02)(1000total number of staplers))]/(2(0.02))\n\nWe can simplify this expression:\n\nx = [46400 \u00b1 sqrt(21529600 - 80total number of staplers)]/2\n\nWe know that x is less than the total number of staplers, so we can eliminate the plus sign:\n\nx = [46400 - sqrt(21529600 - 80total number of staplers)]/2\n\nWe also know that x is an integer, so we can try different values of total number of staplers until we get an integer value for x. Starting with the smallest answer choice, we can try:\n\nIf total number of staplers = 4000, then x = [46400 - sqrt(21529600 - 320000)]/2 \u2248 9.

Then we know that the average of the highest and lowest scores is x, so (h + L)/2 = x, which means h + L = 2x. We also know that the average score for the entire class is y, so the sum of all the scores is yz. We can write this as h + L + (sum of all other scores) = yz. Substituting h + L = 2x, we get 2x + (sum of all other scores) = yz. \n\nWe want to find the average score excluding the highest and lowest scores, which means we need to find the sum of all other scores and divide by z - 2 (since there are z students and we are excluding 2 scores). The sum of all other scores is yz - 2x (since we already know h + L = 2x).

During the forward journey, the speed is unknown, so let it be s. Then we have d = 6s. During the return journey, the speed is s + 12 km/hr, and the time is 4 hours less, so the time is d / (s + 12). We know that the total time for the round trip is 6 + (d / (s + 12)), so we can set up the equation:\n\n6 + (d / (s + 12)) = 6 + (d / s)\n\nMultiplying both sides by s(s + 12), we get:\n\n6s(s + 12) + d(s + 12) = 6s^2 + ds\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n6s^2 + 72s + d(s + 12) = 6s^2 + ds\n\nRearranging and simplifying, we get:\n\nd = 72s / 11\n\nSubstituting d = 6s, we get:\n\n6s = 72s / 11\n\nSolving for s, we get s = 11 km/hr. Substituting back into d = 6s, we get d = 66 km. During the return journey, the speed is s + 12 = 23 km/hr, and the time is 4 hours less, so the distance traveled is 23 * (6 - 4) = 46 km.

Then the original retail price is $x + 60$. If it was sold for 20% less than the original price, then it was sold for $(1-0.2)(x+60) = 0.8x + 48$. \n\nThe profit made on the sale is the difference between the selling price and the wholesale cost, which is $(0.8x + 48) - x = -0.2x + 48$. Since the profit is negative, the item was sold for less than the wholesale cost. \n\nTo find the percentage by which it was sold for less than the wholesale cost, we divide the profit by the wholesale cost: $\\frac{-0.2x + 48}{x} = -0.2 + \\frac{48}{x}$. We don't know the value of $x$, but we do know that it is positive (since it is a cost). Therefore, the expression $-0.2 + \\frac{48}{x}$ is negative, and we want to find the absolute value of this expression as a percentage of $x$. \n\nWe can rewrite the expression as $\\frac{48}{x} - 0.2 = \\frac{48 - 0.2x}{x}$. Since $x$ is positive, we have $\\frac{48 - 0.2x}{x} < \\frac{48}{x}$, so the percentage we want is less than 100%. \n\nTo estimate the answer, we can plug in a value of $x$. For example, if $x = 100$, then the percentage is $\\frac{48 - 0.2(100)}{100} \\approx 28\\%$. Since the answer choices are spread out, we can eliminate (A) and (E) as too small and too large, respectively. \n\nTo get a more precise answer, we can solve $\\frac{48 - 0.2x}{x} = 0.28$ for $x$: \n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{48 - 0.2x}{x} &= 0.28 \\\\\n48 - 0.2x &= 0.28x \\\\\n48 &= 0.48x \\\\\nx &= 100\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }28\\%}$.", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "B"}

The square of this number would be abcde1^2 = abcde10000 + 2abcde1 + 1. We know that this number is three times as large as the number formed by abcde01, which is abcde1 with the last two digits swapped. So we can write:\n\n3(abcde01) = abcde10000 + 2abcde1 + 1\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3abcde + 3 = abcde10000 + 2abcde1 + 1\n\nabcde10000 - 2abcde1 = 3abcde - 2\n\nWe can see that the left-hand side is divisible by 9, so the right-hand side must also be divisible by 9.

So there is 1 - 4/3 = 1/3 of the job left to be done. Mr. Black can complete 1/8 of the job in one day, so he can complete 6/8 = 3/4 of the job in 6 days. This means there is 1/4 of the job left to be done. Let x be the number of days it takes Mr. Blue to complete the remaining 1/4 of the job. Then we can set up the equation (1/12)x = 1/4, which simplifies to x = 3. So it will take Mr. Blue 3 days to complete the remaining 1/4 of the job. Therefore, the total number of days it will take to complete the job is 8 + 6 + 3 = 17 days. The answer is (D).", "pred_strict": "D", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "D"}

However, the surface area of the cubes on the inside of the larger cube are not painted, so we need to subtract the surface area of the 5^2 = 25 cubes on each face of the larger cube. Each of these cubes has a surface area of 4(1cm)^2 = 4 cm^2, so the total surface area of the unpainted cubes is 25(4 cm^2) = 100 cm^2. Therefore, the surface area of the painted cubes is 750 cm^2 - 100 cm^2 = 650 cm^2.

Then how mnya levsau fo M are mreo thna 300.\nChoices: (A)20 (B)30 (C)40 (D)200 (E)None\nAnswer:", "output": "We can write $M = 100b + 10a + c$ and $N = 100c + 10b + a$. Since $M > N$, we have $b > c$. Then, $M - N = 99(b-c) + 9(a-b)$. We can rewrite the given equation as $99(b-c) + 9(a-b) + 396c = 990$, which simplifies to $11(b-c) + (a-b) + 44c = 110$. Since $b > c$, we have $11(b-c) \\ge 11$, so $a-b + 44c \\le 99$. We can also see that $a-b + 44c \\ge 0$, so $0 \\le a-b+44c \\le 99$. The only possible values for $a-b+44c$ are $0, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99$. We can check each case to see which ones satisfy the equation. If $a-b+44c = 0$, then $11(b-c) = 110$, which is not possible since $b > c$. If $a-b+44c = 11$, then $11(b-c) = 99$, which means $b-c = 9$ and $a-b+44c = 11$. Solving this system of equations gives $(a,b,c) = (5,9,0)$, which corresponds to $M = 950$ and $N = 59$. This does not satisfy the condition that $M > N$, so we move on to the next case. If $a-b+44c = 22$, then $11(b-c) = 88$, which means $b-c = 8$ and $a-b+44c = 22$. Solving this system of equations gives $(a,b,c) = (4,8,0)$, which corresponds to $M = 840$ and $N = 48$. This satisfies the condition that $M > N$, so we check if $M$ is greater than 300. Since $M$ is a three-digit number, we know that $b \\neq 0$. If $b = 1$, then $a$ must be at least 2, which means $M$ is at least 120. If $b = 2$, then $a$ must be at least 3, which means $M$ is at least 230. If $b = 3$, then $a$ must be at least 4, which means $M$ is at least 340.

Then the oldest member is 7 + (n-1)d years old. The average age of all the members is (youngest + oldest)/2 = (7 + 7 + (n-1)d)/2 = (14 + (n-1)d)/2. \n\nSince the members' ages are in arithmetic progression, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find that the sum of all the members' ages is n/2 * (youngest + oldest) = n/2 * (7 + 7 + (n-1)d) = n/2 * (14 + (n-1)d). \n\nWe are given that this sum is 250, so we can set up the equation: n/2 * (14 + (n-1)d) = 250. \n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 and simplifying, we get: n^2 + 13n - 1000 = 0. \n\nFactoring, we get: (n-25)(n+40) = 0. Since n must be positive, we have n = 25. \n\nTherefore, there are 25 members in the club. The answer is (C).", "pred_strict": "C", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "C"}

In those 3 hours, Train A travels 40 km/hr * 3 hrs = 120 km. Let's call the distance between Mumbai and the point where the two trains meet \"x\". \n\nWhen Train B leaves, the two trains are approaching each other at a combined speed of 40 km/hr + 72 km/hr = 112 km/hr. So the time it takes for them to meet is x / 112. \n\nWe know that Train A has already traveled 120 km, so the distance remaining for Train B to travel is (x - 120).

Let the total number of employees be 100, so 75 employees take a vacation. Let the number of employees who take a winter vacation be x, and the number of employees who take both a winter and summer vacation be y. Then, the number of employees who take only a summer vacation is 0.4(75) - y, and the number of employees who take neither vacation is 20. \n\nUsing this information, we can create the following Venn diagram: \n\n[asy]\nlabel(\"Winter\", (0,70));\nlabel(\"Summer\", (70,70));\ndraw(Circle((35,35), 35));\ndraw(Circle((70,35), 35));\nlabel(\"$x$\", (17.5, 35));\nlabel(\"$y$\", (52.5, 35));\nlabel(\"$0.4(75)-y$\", (70, 52.5));\nlabel(\"$20$\", (35, 0));\nlabel(\"$75$\", (52.5, 52.5));\n[/asy]\n\nWe want to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, which is represented by the area shaded in blue. This is equal to $0.4(75)-y$, so we need to find the value of y. \n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that $y + x = 0.4(75)$ (since the number of employees who take both vacations is counted twice in this expression). We can also see that $x + y + 0.4(75)-y + 20 = 100$, since the total number of employees is 100. Simplifying this equation gives $x = 5$. \n\nSubstituting this value of x into the first equation gives $y = 0.4(75) - x = 0.4(75) - 5 = 20$. \n\nTherefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is $0.4(75)-y = 0.4(75)-20 = 5$.

We know that x^2 - y^2 = 256000 and xy = 1000. Factoring x^2 - y^2, we get (x+y)(x-y) = 256000. We also know that xy = 1000, so y = 1000/x. Substituting this into the first equation, we get x^2 - (1000/x)^2 = 256000. Simplifying, we get x^4 - 256000x^2 - 1000000 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in x^2, so we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x^2: x^2 = (256000 \u00b1 sqrt(256000^2 + 4(1)(1000000)))/2 = 640 or -1560. Since x and y are both positive, we can discard the negative solution. So x^2 = 640, which means x = 8sqrt(10). Substituting this into xy = 1000, we get y = 125/sqrt(10). Therefore, the two numbers are approximately 628 and 372. The answer is (B).", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "B"}

What is the nimummi number of perpco coins that hes brought?\nChoices: (A)4 (B)3 (C)2 (D)1 (E)0\nAnswer:", "output": "Let's call the number of nickel coins \"n\" and the number of brass coins \"b\". We can set up two equations based on the information given:\n\n0.20n + 0.25b = 3.40 (since she gets 20 cents for each nickel and 25 cents for each brass coin)\nn + b = minimum number of coins (since we want to find the minimum number of coins she brought)\n\nWe can simplify the first equation by multiplying both sides by 100 to get rid of the decimals:\n\n20n + 25b = 340\n\nNow we can use elimination to solve for one of the variables. If we multiply the second equation by 20, we can eliminate n:\n\n20n + 20b = minimum number of coins x 20\n20n + 25b = 340\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\n5b = 340 - minimum number of coins x 20\n\nWe want to find the minimum number of coins, so we need to find a value for it that makes \"b\" a positive integer. The smallest possible value for \"b\" is 1 (since she must have brought at least one coin), so we can plug that in and solve for the minimum number of coins:\n\n5(1) = 340 - minimum number of coins x 20\n5 = 340 - minimum number of coins x 20\n335 = minimum number of coins x 20\nminimum number of coins = 16.75\n\nSince the minimum number of coins must be a whole number, we can round up to 17. But we need to check if that works:\n\n0.20n + 0.25b = 3.40\nn + b = 17\n\nWe can use trial and error to find values of \"n\" and \"b\" that satisfy both equations. One possible solution is n = 6 and b = 11:\n\n0.20(6) + 0.25(11) = 3.40\n6 + 11 = 17\n\nSo the minimum number of nickel and brass coins she brought is 6 + 11 = 17.

For each color, the number of combinations is:\n\n- Red: 8(7)/2 = 28\n- Olive: 13(12)/2 = 78\n- Blue: 10(9)/2 = 45\n- Pink: 5(4)/2 = 10\n- Green: 4(3)/2 = 6\n\nThe total number of combinations is 28 + 78 + 45 + 10 + 6 = 167. However, we have counted each pair twice (once for each tie), so we need to divide by 2 to get the actual number of pairs. Therefore, we need to take out 83 pairs from the rack. Since each pair consists of two ties, we need to take out 2*83 = 166 ties. The answer is (E).", "pred_strict": "E", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "E"}

Let's assume they meet at time t. Then, train M has traveled a distance of 4x, where x is its speed, and train N has traveled a distance of 3.5y, where y is its speed. Since they meet, we know that 4x + 3.5y = distance between City A and City B. \n\nWe also know that train M started at 5 am and train N started at 7 am, so train N has been traveling for 2 hours less than train M. Therefore, we can write 3.5y = (4 + 2)(x), since train N has traveled for 2 hours less than train M. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get 3.5y = 6x + 2x = 8x. Substituting this into the first equation, we get 4x + 8/2 x = distance between City A and City B. Solving for x, we get x = (1/2) distance between City A and City B. \n\nNow we can find the time it takes for them to meet: train M travels (1/2) distance between City A and City B in 2.5 hours (since it leaves at 5 am and arrives at 7:30 am), so its speed is (1/2)/(2.5) = 1/5 of the distance between City A and City B per hour. Therefore, it takes train M (1/5)t hours to travel to the meeting point. \n\nSimilarly, train N travels (1/2) distance between City A and City B in 3.5 hours (since it leaves at 7 am and arrives at 10:30 am), so its speed is (1/2)/(3.5) = 1/7 of the distance between City A and City B per hour. Therefore, it takes train N (1/7)(t-2) hours to travel to the meeting point. \n\nSince they meet at the same time, we can set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for t: \n\n(1/5)t = (1/7)(t-2) \n\nMultiplying both sides by 35, we get: \n\n7t = 5t - 10 \n\n2t = 10 \n\nt = 5 \n\nTherefore, they meet at 5 hours after train M leaves City A, which is at 10 am. So they meet at 10 am + 5 hours = 3 pm. The time they cross each other is 3 pm - 7 am = 8 hours. \n\nThe answer is (D), 56 minutes.", "pred_strict": "D", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "D"}

So:\n\n1/5 + 1/4 = 9/20\n\nThis means that together, they earn 9/20 of the cost of the cake in one hour. To find out how long it will take for them to earn enough together, we can set up the equation:\n\n(9/20)x = 1\n\nWhere x is the number of hours it will take for them to earn enough together. Solving for x, we get:\n\nx = 20/9\n\nThis is approximately equal to 2.22 hours, which we can round to 2 hours. The answer is (B).", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "C"}

Let the length and width of the plot be L and W, respectively. Then, we have 2L + 2W = 340, which simplifies to L + W = 170. \n\nWe are given that the cost of gardening is 10 per square meter, so the cost of gardening the entire rectangular plot would be 10LW. We want to find the product LW, which represents the area of the plot. \n\nWe can use the fact that L + W = 170 to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. For example, we can solve for L by subtracting W from both sides: L = 170 - W. Substituting this expression for L into the equation LW = area, we get:\n\n(170 - W)W = area \n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n170W - W^2 = area \n\nTo maximize the area, we want to find the value of W that maximizes the quadratic expression 170W - W^2. We can do this by completing the square:\n\n170W - W^2 = -(W^2 - 170W) = -(W^2 - 170W + 7225 - 7225) = -[(W - 85)^2 - 7225]\n\nThe expression is maximized when (W - 85)^2 is minimized, which occurs when W = 85. Substituting this value of W back into the equation L + W = 170, we get L = 85. \n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the rectangular plot are L = 85 meters and W = 85 meters, and the area is LW = 7225 square meters. The cost of gardening the entire plot is 10LW = 72250. The answer is (C).", "pred_strict": "C", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "C"}

Let's assume the merchant chooses to take the discount and pay within 30 days. They would pay 96% of the original price, which is $20,000 * 0.96 = $19,200. \n\nNow, let's assume the merchant borrows money to pay for the motor and wants to know the highest simple interest rate they can afford to pay back the loan and still make a profit from the discount. The amount of the loan would be $19,200, and the interest would be the difference between the full price and the discounted price, which is $20,000 - $19,200 = $800. \n\nLet's use the formula I = Prt to solve for the interest rate.

We also know that 50% of the files were not detected by a virus, so V = 0.5(250 - W - B).\n\nSubstituting W = 2.5B and V = 0.5(250 - W - B) into the first equation, we get:\n\n0.5(250 - W - B) + W + B = 250\n125 - 0.5W + 1.5B = 250\n-0.5W + 1.5B = 125\n\nSubstituting W = 2.5B into this equation, we get:\n\n-0.5(2.5B) + 1.5B = 125\n-0.625B = 125\nB = 200\n\nSo there are 200 files infected by both a virus and a worm. This means there are 250 - 200 = 50 files not infected by either. Since we know that W = 2.5B, we can find that W = 2.5(200) = 500. Therefore, the number of files not infected by a worm is 50 - 500 = -450. This doesn't make sense, so there must be an error in the problem.

If one oarsman weighing 53 kg is replaced by a new one, then the total weight of the oarsmen becomes 18 kg - 53 kg + the weight of the new oarsman. The weight of the new oarsman is therefore 53 kg - 18 kg + the weight of the new oarsman, which simplifies to 35 kg + the weight of the new oarsman. Since there are still 10 oarsmen, the new average weight is (18 kg - 53 kg + the weight of the new oarsman) / 10 = (35 kg + the weight of the new oarsman) / 10. Solving for the weight of the new oarsman, we get (35 kg + the weight of the new oarsman) / 10 = 1.8 kg, which means the weight of the new oarsman is 16 kg.

Then, Jack finishes 8 units of the job (since he finishes two-thirds of it). This means that there are 4 units of the job left for Jill to do. \n\nSince Jill's rate is only 5% of Jack's rate, we can say that her rate is (1/20) of Jack's rate. Let's say Jack's rate is J units of the job per hour, then Jill's rate is (1/20)J units of the job per hour. \n\nWe want to find how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining 4 units of the job. Let's say it takes her T hours. Then, we can set up the equation: \n\n(1/20)J * T = 4 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\nT = 80/J \n\nWe know that Jack can finish the entire job in 12 hours, so his rate is: \n\nJ = 1 job / 12 hours = 1/12 job per hour \n\nSubstituting this into our equation for T, we get: \n\nT = 80 / (1/12) = 960 \n\nSo it takes Jill 960 hours to finish the remaining 4 units of the job. However, this answer doesn't match any of the choices given. We can convert hours to days by dividing by 24: \n\n960 hours / 24 hours/day = 40 days \n\nSo the answer is (not given in choices) 40 days.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "", "GT": "E"}

Let J = Joe's age, S = sister's age, and F = father's age.

We can simplify this to S = 2J.\n\nFrom the third sentence, we know that when Joe is as old as his father was when his sister was as old as Joe, their age difference is F - J = F - (S - J). We can simplify this to F - J = F - S + J, which becomes 2J = F - S.\n\nNow we can substitute S = 2J and 2J = F - S into the equation J + S + F = 100 to get:\n\nJ + 2J + (2J + S) = 100\n5J + 2S = 100\n\nSubstituting S = 2J into this equation gives:\n\n5J + 4J = 100\n9J = 100\nJ = 11.11 (repeating)\n\nSince J is not a whole number, we made a mistake somewhere.

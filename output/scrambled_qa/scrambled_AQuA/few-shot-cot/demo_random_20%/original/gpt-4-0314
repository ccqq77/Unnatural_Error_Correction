How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?\nChoices: (A)10,8 (B)9,8 (C)7,8 (D)5,6 (E)11,12\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the number of white sharpeners be x and the number of brown sharpeners be y. Then x + y = 18. The cost of each white sharpener is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpener, so the total cost is x(1 + cost of brown sharpener) + y(cost of brown sharpener) = 100. We can rewrite this equation as x + y(cost of brown sharpener) + x = 100. Since x + y = 18, we can substitute this into the equation to get 18(cost of brown sharpener) + x = 100. \n\nNow we can use the answer choices to find the correct values for x and y. Choice (A) gives x = 10 and y = 8, so 18(cost of brown sharpener) + 10 = 100. This simplifies to 8(cost of brown sharpener) = 90, which means the cost of brown sharpener is 90/8 = 11.25. This is not an integer value, so choice (A) is not correct. \n\nChoice (B) gives x = 9 and y = 8, so 18(cost of brown sharpener) + 9 = 100. This simplifies to 9(cost of brown sharpener) = 91, which means the cost of brown sharpener is 91/9 = 10.11. This is not an integer value, so choice (B) is not correct. \n\nChoice (C) gives x = 7 and y = 8, so 18(cost of brown sharpener) + 7 = 100. This simplifies to 11(cost of brown sharpener) = 93, which means the cost of brown sharpener is 93/11 = 8.45. This is not an integer value, so choice (C) is not correct. \n\nChoice (D) gives x = 5 and y = 6, so 18(cost of brown sharpener) + 5 = 100. This simplifies to 13(cost of brown sharpener) = 95, which means the cost of brown sharpener is 95/13 = 7.31. This is not an integer value, so choice (D) is not correct. \n\nChoice (E) gives x = 11 and y = 12, so 18(cost of brown sharpener) + 11 = 100. This simplifies to 7(cost of brown sharpener) = 89, which means the cost of brown sharpener is 89/7 = 12.71. This is not an integer value, so choice (E) is not correct. \n\nSince none of the answer choices give integer values for the cost of brown sharpener, there must be an error in the problem or the answer choices.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "A"}

The sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula Sn = n/2 * (a1 + an), where Sn is the sum of the progression, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. In this case, Sn = 250, a1 = 7, and the common difference d = 3/12 = 0.25 years. \n\nWe can find the last term an using the formula an = a1 + (n-1)d. Substituting this into the sum formula, we get:\n\n250 = n/2 * (7 + (7 + (n-1)(0.25)))\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n500 = n * (7 + 7 + 0.25n - 0.25)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n500 = n * (14 + 0.25n - 0.25)\n\n500 = n * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nNow, we can try plugging in the answer choices for n and see which one works:\n\n(A) 18: 500 = 18 * (13.75 + 0.25(18)) = 18 * 18.25 \u2260 500\n(B) 20: 500 = 20 * (13.75 + 0.25(20)) = 20 * 18 = 360 \u2260 500\n(C) 25: 500 = 25 * (13.75 + 0.25(25)) = 25 * 20 = 500\n\nSince choice (C) works, the number of members in the club is 25.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "C"}

To find the measure of minor arc AD, we can subtract the measure of minor arc BD from the sum of minor arc AB and minor arc AC. So, minor arc AD = (80\u00b0 + 160\u00b0) - 150\u00b0 = 240\u00b0 - 150\u00b0 = 90\u00b0. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We made an error in our calculation.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Since B bisects minor arc AC, minor arc AB is half of minor arc AC, which is 80\u00b0. The measure of minor arc BC is also 80\u00b0. Now, we can find the measure of minor arc CD by subtracting the measure of minor arc BC from the measure of minor arc BD. So, minor arc CD = 150\u00b0 - 80\u00b0 = 70\u00b0. Finally, we can find the measure of minor arc AD by adding the measures of minor arc AB and minor arc CD. So, minor arc AD = 80\u00b0 + 70\u00b0 = 150\u00b0. The answer is (C).", "pred_strict": "C", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "B"}

At that time, the difference in age between Joe and his sister will be F - 2S. \n\nWhen Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father, so his father will be 2(F - S) years old. At that time, the difference in age between Joe and his father will be F - J. \n\nSince the difference in age between Joe and his sister and the difference in age between Joe and his father are equal, we have F - 2S = F - J. This simplifies to J = 2S. \n\nNow we have a system of equations: \nJ + S + F = 100\nJ = 2S\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get 2S + S + F = 100, which simplifies to 3S + F = 100. \n\nWe also have the equation F = 2(F - S), which simplifies to F = 2F - 2S, or S = F/2. \n\nSubstituting this equation into the equation 3S + F = 100, we get 3(F/2) + F = 100, which simplifies to 3F/2 + F = 100, or 5F/2 = 100.

Their product is x(x+1)(x+2) = 727+728+729. This simplifies to x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x = 2184. We can factor out an x from the left side to get x(x^2 + 3x + 2) = 2184. Since 2184 is divisible by 2, we know that x must be even. We can try different even values of x until we find one that works. If x = 2, then x^2 + 3x + 2 = 12, which is too small. If x = 4, then x^2 + 3x + 2 = 30, which is still too small. If x = 6, then x^2 + 3x + 2 = 56, which is still too small. If x = 8, then x^2 + 3x + 2 = 90, which is still too small. If x = 10, then x^2 + 3x + 2 = 132, which is still too small. If x = 12, then x^2 + 3x + 2 = 182, which is still too small. If x = 14, then x^2 + 3x + 2 = 240, which is still too small. If x = 16, then x^2 + 3x + 2 = 306, which is still too small. If x = 18, then x^2 + 3x + 2 = 380, which is still too small. If x = 20, then x^2 + 3x + 2 = 462, which is still too small. If x = 22, then x^2 + 3x + 2 = 552, which is still too small. If x = 24, then x^2 + 3x + 2 = 650, which is still too small. If x = 26, then x^2 + 3x + 2 = 756, which is too large. So the three consecutive integers are 24, 25, and 26, and their sum is 24+25+26 = 75. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We made an error in our calculations.\n\nLet's try factoring the equation x(x^2 + 3x + 2) = 2184 differently. We can rewrite the equation as x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x - 2184 = 0. We can use the Rational Root Theorem to find a rational root of this equation. The possible rational roots are the factors of 2184 divided by the factors of 1. The factors of 2184 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 24, 26, 39, 52, 78, 104, 156, 312, 546, and 2184. We can try each of these as a possible value of x. We find that x = 12 is a root of the equation, since 12^3 + 3(12)^2 + 2(12) - 2184 = 0. So the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14, and their sum is 12+13+14 = 39.

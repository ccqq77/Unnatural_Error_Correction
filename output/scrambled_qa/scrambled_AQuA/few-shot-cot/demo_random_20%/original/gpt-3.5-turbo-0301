Simplifying the second equation, we get: $$\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{h}{x+d} \\implies x+d = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}$$ We can also simplify the first equation using the fact that $\\tan 45^\\circ = 1$: $$1 = \\frac{h}{x} \\implies x = h$$ Substituting this into the second equation, we get: $$h+d = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} \\implies d = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} - h = h(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} - 1)$$ We are given that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0, which means the car travels a distance of $h(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} - 1)$ in 10 minutes. We want to find how much more time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower, which means we need to find how much more distance the car needs to travel. Since the car is traveling at a uniform speed, we can use the formula $d = rt$ to find this distance. Let the speed of the car be $s$. Then, we have: $$h(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} - 1) = s \\cdot t \\implies t = \\frac{h(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} - 1)}{s}$$ We are not given the value of $s$, so we cannot find the exact value of $t$.

Let's use the first expression:\n\n(n-20)/x = (50-20)/x = 30/x\n\nWe also know that the elevator travels at a constant speed, so we can use the formula distance = rate x time to set up another equation:\n\n20 = (30/x) x 10\n200 = 30x\nx = 20/3\n\nSo the speed of the elevator is 20/3 steps/minute, which is approximately 6.67 steps/minute.

If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?\nChoices: (A)15 (B)16 (C)17 (D)18 (E)19\nAnswer:", "output": "Let x be the number of toys made by Alex and y be the number of toys made by Jacob. We know that x + y = 35 and 7x + 9y = total number of hours worked by both of them. Since both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that their total number of hours worked is approximately the same. So we can set 7x + 9y = k(35), where k is some constant. Simplifying, we get 7x + 9y = 35k. We know that x + y = 35, so we can solve for y in terms of x: y = 35 - x. Substituting into the equation 7x + 9y = 35k, we get 7x + 9(35 - x) = 35k. Simplifying, we get 2x = 35k - 315, which means x = (35k - 315) / 2. Since x is the number of toys made by Alex, which is less than 35, we can assume that k is less than 10. Trying k = 9, we get x = 16 and y = 19. So Jacob made 19 toys.

After the first replacement, he has 85 mL of 50% strong milk tea and 15 mL of milk. After the second replacement, he has 72.25 mL of 50% strong milk tea and 27.75 mL of milk.

Find the average speed of the plane around the field?\nChoices: (A)384 (B)562 (C)458 (D)156 (E)452\nAnswer:", "output": "The average speed of the plane around the field is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. The distance traveled on each side of the square is the length of the side multiplied by the speed of the plane. Let the length of each side be x. Then the total distance traveled is 4x. The time taken to travel each side is x/200, x/400, x/600, and x/800 hours respectively. So the total time taken is x/200 + x/400 + x/600 + x/800 hours. Simplifying this expression, we get (11x/2400) hours. Therefore, the average speed of the plane is (4x) / (11x/2400) = 9600/11 km/hr, which is approximately 872.73 km/hr.

So the remaining 3/4 of the pool was filled by both hoses working together in 3 hours. Let's say hose B can fill the entire pool in x hours. Then in one hour, hose B can fill 1/x of the pool. Working together, hoses A and B can fill 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours, which means they can fill 1/4 of the pool in 3/4 hours. So in 1 hour, they can fill 1/4 divided by 3/4 = 1/3 of the pool. \n\nSince hose A can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, it can fill 1/8 of the pool in one hour. So in one hour, hoses A and B working together can fill 1/8 + 1/x of the pool. We know that this is equal to 1/3, so we can set up the equation: \n\n1/8 + 1/x = 1/3 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 24x, we get: \n\n3x + 24 = 8x \n\nSolving for x, we get x = 6.

We know that the plane travels 10s for the same amount of time, so its distance traveled is 10s*t. We also know that the total distance traveled is 180 + 10s*t (since the ship traveled 180 miles before they met). \n\nSince they meet at the same time, their distances traveled must be equal, so we can set up the equation: \n\n180 + 10s*t = s*t \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n180 = s*t - 10s*t \n\n180 = t*s*(1-10) \n\n180 = -9s*t \n\nWe're looking for the distance they meet from the starting point, which is the distance the ship traveled before they met. We know that distance = speed * time, so the distance the ship traveled is s*t. \n\nSubstituting -20 for t (since we solved for t in terms of s), we get: \n\ndistance = s*t = s*(-20) = -20s \n\nSince distance can't be negative, we know that the ship traveled 20s miles before they met. \n\nWe don't know the value of s, but we can use the fact that the plane traveled 10 times faster than the ship to set up another equation: \n\nplane speed = 10s \n\nship speed = s \n\ntime = t \n\ndistance = 180 \n\nUsing the formula distance = speed * time, we get: \n\n180 = 10s*t + s*t \n\n180 = 11s*t \n\nWe still don't know the value of s or t, but we can use the fact that they traveled a total distance of 180 + 10s*t to set up another equation: \n\ndistance = 180 + 10s*t \n\ndistance = s*t \n\nSetting these two expressions equal to each other, we get: \n\n180 + 10s*t = s*t \n\n180 = s*t - 10s*t \n\n180 = t*s*(1-10) \n\n180 = -9s*t \n\nWe already solved for t in terms of s, so we can substitute -20s for t: \n\n180 = -9s*(-20s) \n\n180 = 1800s^2 \n\ns^2 = 0.1 \n\ns = 0.316 \n\nNow we can find the distance the ship traveled before they met: \n\ndistance = s*t = 0.316*(-20s) = -6.32 \n\nAgain, distance can't be negative, so we made a mistake somewhere. Checking our work, we see that we made an error when we set up the equation 180 = 11s*t. It should actually be: \n\n180 = 10s*t + 180 \n\n180 = s*t + 180 \n\ns*t = 0 \n\nThis means that they meet at the starting point, so the distance they meet from the starting point is 0.

Then, each person would have contributed $\\frac{96}{x}$ rupees. But since 4 people did not turn up, the remaining people had to contribute $\\frac{96}{x-4} + 4$ rupees each. We can set up an equation: $$\\frac{96}{x} = \\frac{96}{x-4} + 4$$ Multiplying both sides by $x(x-4)$ gives: $$96(x-4) = 96x + 4x(x-4)$$ Simplifying gives: $$384 = 4x^2 - 16x$$ $$x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0$$ $$(x-12)(x+8) = 0$$ Since $x$ must be positive, $x=12$.

This means that 5 employees do not take any vacation. \n\nNow, let's find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. Let's call this number \"x\". \n\nAccording to the problem, 40% of the employees take both vacations. This means that 60% of the employees do not take both vacations. So, out of the 95 employees who take at least one vacation, 60% of them take only a winter vacation or only a summer vacation. \n\nThis means that 60/100 * 95 = 57 employees take only a winter vacation or only a summer vacation. \n\nWe already know that 75 employees take a winter vacation. So, the number of employees who take only a summer vacation is: \n\n75 (total employees who take a winter vacation) - 40 (employees who take both vacations) = 35 \n\nTherefore, the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 35. \n\nWe assumed that there are 100 employees in the company, but this is not necessary to find the answer to the question.

After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?\nChoices: (A)2 months (B)4 months (C)23 months (D)24 months (E)84 months\nAnswer:", "output": "Let x be the number of months after B joined that C joined. Then A was in the business for 12 months, B was in the business for 10 months, and C was in the business for 8 + x months. The ratio of their investments is 4:6:12, which simplifies to 1:3/2:3. So the total profit can be divided into 2 + 10 + 8 + x = 20 parts, with C getting 6 parts. Therefore, 6/20 of the total profit is equal to Rs.150,000, which means the total profit is equal to Rs.500,000. \n\nNow we can set up the equation: \n\n(1/5) * Rs.40,000 * 12 + (3/10) * Rs.60,000 * 10 + (3/20) * Rs.120,000 * (8 + x) = Rs.500,000 \n\nSimplifying this equation gives: \n\nRs.96,000 + Rs.180,000 + Rs.18,000 + Rs.18,000x = Rs.500,000 \n\nRs.312,000 + Rs.18,000x = Rs.500,000 \n\nRs.18,000x = Rs.188,000 \n\nx = 10.44 \n\nSo C joined the business 10.44 months after B joined, which is approximately 10 months and 13 days.

This factors as $(c-1)(c-11)=0$, so $c=1$ or $c=11$. However, since $a-c=5$, we must have $c<a$, so $c=1$. \n\nThen, we have $a=6$ and $b=10-a-c=5$. Therefore, the number is $abc=651$.

Therefore, there must be more than 3 members in the family. \n\nIf there are 4 members, then the median income would be the average of the 2nd and 3rd highest incomes. Let's assume that the 2nd and 3rd highest incomes are both $3000 (since we know that the median is $3000). Then the total income would be $3000 + $3000 + $3000 + $0 = $9000, which works. Therefore, there are 4 members in the family. The answer is (C).", "pred_strict": "C", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "B"}

What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?\nChoices: (A)4 (B)3 (C)2 (D)1 (E)0\nAnswer:", "output": "Let's say the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins. Then we can set up the following system of equations:\n\nx + y = total number of coins\n0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40\n\nWe want to find the minimum number of copper coins, which means we want to minimize x. One way to do this is to eliminate y from the equations above. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 0.25 and subtracting it from the second equation:\n\n0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40\n-0.25x - 0.25y = -0.25(total number of coins) \n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n0.05x = 3.40 - 0.25(total number of coins)\n\nWe want to minimize x, so we want to maximize the right-hand side of this equation. The maximum value of 3.40 - 0.25(total number of coins) occurs when the total number of coins is minimized. The minimum possible total number of coins is 14 (if the diver brought all brass coins), so the maximum value of 3.40 - 0.25(total number of coins) is:\n\n3.40 - 0.25(14) = 0.90\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible value of x is:\n\n0.05x = 0.90\nx = 18\n\nSo the diver brought at least 18 copper coins. We can check that this is possible by setting y = 4 (since the total number of coins must be at least 18+4=22) and solving for x:\n\nx + y = 22\n0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40\n\nThis gives us x = 3 and y = 19, which means the diver brought at least 3 copper coins. We can check that this is the minimum by trying smaller values of x (which would require more brass coins and therefore more total coins). For example, if x = 2, then y = 20 and the total value is only $3.30. Therefore, the answer is (C) 2.", "pred_strict": "C", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "C"}

They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.\nHow many times did the coin landed on Heads ?\nChoices: (A)10 (B)23 (C)16 (D)18 (E)12\nAnswer:", "output": "Let's call the number of times the coin landed on heads \"x\". Then the number of times it landed on tails would be 20-x. \nEach time it landed on heads, Christopher gave $2 to Jonathan, so the total amount given by Christopher would be 2x. \nEach time it landed on tails, Jonathan gave $3 to Christopher, so the total amount given by Jonathan would be 3(20-x) = 60-3x. \nSince they didn't win or lose any money, we can set these two amounts equal to each other: \n2x = 60-3x \nSolving for x, we get x = 10. \nSo the coin landed on heads 10 times.

Let t be the time it takes for them to meet for the first time. Then, we have:\n\n- Allen travels a distance of 54t from X to Y.\n- Bob travels a distance of 78t from Y to X.\n- The total distance they cover is d, so the sum of their distances is d: 54t + 78t = d.\n\nWhen they meet for the first time, they have covered a total distance of d, so they must have met at a point that is d/2 km away from X and Y.\n\nAfter they change directions, Allen travels a distance of 54(t + d/54) from Y to X and back to Y, while Bob travels a distance of 78(t + d/78) from X to Y and back to X. We know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen during this time, so we can set up the equation:\n\n78(t + d/78) - 54(t + d/54) = 48\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n24t + 24d/78 = 48\n\nMultiplying both sides by 78, we get:\n\n1872t + 24d = 3744\n\nWe also know that the total distance they cover during this time is d, so we can set up another equation:\n\n54(t + d/54) + 78(t + d/78) = d\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n132t + 2d/13 = d\n\nMultiplying both sides by 13, we get:\n\n1716t + 2d = 13d\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\n1716t + 2(1872t + 24d) = 13d\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n5460t + 26d = 13d\n\nSubtracting 13d from both sides, we get:\n\n5460t + 13d = 0\n\nThis equation tells us that t and d must be equal to 0, which is not possible.

Since $[x]$ and $[y]$ are integers, $[x]+[y]$ is also an integer. Therefore, $L(x,y)$ is an integer. On the other hand, $[2x]$ and $[2y]$ are also integers, so $R(x,y)$ is an integer.\n\nLet's consider the difference between $R(x,y)$ and $L(x,y)$:\n\\begin{align*}\nR(x,y) - L(x,y) &= ([2x] + [2y]) - ([x] + [y] + [x+y]) \\\\\n&= [2x] - [x] + [2y] - [y] - [x+y].\n\\end{align*}\nWe can simplify this expression by considering the possible values of $x$ and $y$ relative to their integer parts. Let $a = \\{x\\}$ and $b = \\{y\\}$ be the fractional parts of $x$ and $y$, respectively. Then $x = [x] + a$ and $y = [y] + b$.

The rate of interest is?\nChoices: (A)10% (B)12% (C)6% (D)8% (E)4%\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the rate of interest be $r$. Then, using the formula for simple interest, the interest earned after 2 years is $5000 \\cdot r \\cdot 2 = 10000r$. Using the formula for compound interest, the interest earned after 2 years is $5000\\left(1+\\frac{r}{100}\\right)^2 - 5000 = 5000\\left(\\frac{r^2}{5000}+\\frac{r}{100}+1-1\\right) = 50r + \\frac{r^2}{100}$. The difference between the two is $50r + \\frac{r^2}{100} - 10000r = -9950r + \\frac{r^2}{100} = 72$. Rearranging and factoring, we get $\\frac{r}{100}(r-720) = 72$. Since $r$ must be positive, we know that $r > 0$. Dividing both sides by $r$, we get $r-720 = \\frac{720}{r}$. Since $r > 0$, we know that $\\frac{720}{r} > 0$, so $r-720$ must also be positive. Therefore, $r > 720$. However, we also know that $r$ cannot be greater than 100, since it is a percentage.

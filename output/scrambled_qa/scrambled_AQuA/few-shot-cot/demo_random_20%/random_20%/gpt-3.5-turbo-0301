Then we can set up the following equation:\n\ntan(60\u00b0) = (h / x)\ntan(45\u00b0) = (h / (x + d))\n\nwhere d is the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. Simplifying these equations, we get:\n\n\u221a3 = (h / x)\n1 = (h / (x + d))\n\nSolving for h and x, we get:\n\nh = \u221a3x\nd = x(\u221a3 - 1)\n\nWe know that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. This means that the car travels a distance of d in 10 minutes. We can set up the following equation to find x:\n\nx / (distance traveled in 1 minute) = 10 minutes\n\nThe distance traveled in 1 minute is the speed of the car, which we don't know. However, we do know that the car is traveling at a uniform speed, so we can set up another equation:\n\nx / (time taken to travel x + d) = speed of the car\n\nSubstituting the value of d we found earlier, we get:\n\nx / (x + x(\u221a3 - 1)) = speed of the car\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nspeed of the car = x / (2 - \u221a3)\n\nSubstituting this value into the first equation we set up, we can solve for x:\n\nx / (x / (2 - \u221a3)) = 10 minutes\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = 5(\u221a3 + 1)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "A"}

So, there must be more than 20 marbles in the bag.\n\nLet's assume that there are 40 marbles in the bag (20 white and 20 black). When the first 20 marbles are pulled out, they are all white, so there are still 20 black marbles in the bag. When the second 20 marbles are pulled out, one of them is black, so the percentage of black marbles pulled out is 5%. This means that there was only one black marble pulled out of the second set of 20 marbles.

The total number of students is 23x, which is a 4-digit number. The smallest possible value of x is 43, which gives us a total of 1849 students.\n\nTo find the maximum possible number of students, we want to maximize the number of students studying each subject.

Then, the number of students studying each subject is 5x, 8x, and 10x, respectively. To make these numbers as close to equal as possible, we can set 5x = 8x = 10x, which gives us x = 0. To get a 4-digit number, we need x to be at least 10, so the total number of students is 800. \n\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 800 - 1849 = -1049.

Let's say the length of one side is x km. Then the distance traveled at each speed is:\n\n- 200 km/hr for x km = 200x km\n- 400 km/hr for x km = 400x km\n- 600 km/hr for x km = 600x km\n- 800 km/hr for x km = 800x km\n\nThe total distance traveled is 200x + 400x + 600x + 800x = 2000x km. The time taken to travel this distance is equal to the perimeter divided by the average speed. So:\n\n- Time taken = (4x km) / (average speed) hours\n\nWe want to find the average speed, so we can rearrange this equation to get:\n\n- Average speed = (4x km) / (time taken) km/hr\n\nTo find the time taken, we need to divide the total distance by the total speed:\n\n- Total speed = (200 km/hr) + (400 km/hr) + (600 km/hr) + (800 km/hr) = 2000 km/hr\n- Time taken = (total distance) / (total speed) = (2000x km) / (2000 km/hr) = x hours\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for average speed, we get:\n\n- Average speed = (4x km) / (x hours) = 4 km/hr\n\nSo the average speed of the airplane around the square is 4 km/hr.

We know that 24% of S are in both C and M, so $|C \\cap M| = 0.24|S|$. We also know that 20% of members of M are not in C, so $|M \\setminus C| = 0.8|M|$. We want to find $\\frac{|M|}{|S|}$, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle, we have $|C \\cup M| = |C| + |M| - |C \\cap M|$. We know that $|C \\cup M| \\leq |S|$, since every student is either in the chess club, the swim team, or both. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$|M| \\leq |C \\cup M| + |C \\cap M| \\leq |S| + 0.24|S| = 1.24|S|$$\n\nDividing both sides by $|S|$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{|M|}{|S|} \\leq 1.24$$\n\nNow, we use the fact that $|M \\setminus C| = 0.8|M|$ to write:\n\n$$|M \\cap C| = |M| - |M \\setminus C| = |M| - 0.8|M| = 0.2|M|$$\n\nTherefore, $|C \\cap M| = 0.24|S| = 0.24|M| + 0.2|M| = 0.44|M|$.

We can set up two equations using the given information:\n\n$540y + x = 1800$\n$620y + x = 2040$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\n$80y = 240$\n$y = 3$\n\nSubstituting this value of $y$ into either of the equations above, we can solve for $x$:\n\n$540(3) + x = 1800$\n$x = 990$\n\nSo the bill for 500 calls would be:\n\n$500(3) + 990 = 2490$\n\nBut we need to adjust for the fact that only 500 units were consumed, not 540. We can set up a proportion:\n\n$\\frac{500}{540} = \\frac{b}{2490}$\n\nSolving for $b$, we get:\n\n$b = \\frac{500}{540} \\cdot 2490 = 2300$\n\nSo the bill for 500 units would be Rs.2300.

Therefore, minor arc CD has a measure of 360\u00b0 - 150\u00b0 - 80\u00b0 = 130\u00b0. Since minor arc AD is the sum of minor arcs AC, CD, and DA, we have minor arc AD = 160\u00b0 + 130\u00b0 + minor arc DA = 290\u00b0 + minor arc DA. Since the sum of the measures of all the minor arcs on a circle is 360\u00b0, we have minor arc AD + 160\u00b0 + 150\u00b0 + 80\u00b0 = 360\u00b0, which simplifies to minor arc AD = 70\u00b0.

We know that it takes 5 seconds, but we don't know the distance it travels in that time. Let's call that distance \"d\". \n\nUsing the formula, distance = rate x time, we can set up two equations: \n\nd = 17.5 m/s x 5 s  (the distance it travels in 5 seconds)\nd = (1/2) x acceleration x time^2  (the distance it travels while accelerating to its maximum speed) \n\nWe can solve for the acceleration using the first equation: \n\nd = 17.5 m/s x 5 s \nd = 87.5 m \n\nNow we can plug in the values we know into the second equation: \n\n87.5 m = (1/2) x acceleration x (40 s - 5 s)^2 \n87.5 m = (1/2) x acceleration x 35^2 \nacceleration = 0.71 m/s^2 \n\nFinally, we can use the formula, distance = rate x time, to find the length of the space shuttle.

We know that $a+b+c=17$ and $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$. We can also write the number as $100a+10b+c$. If we subtract 495 from this number, we get $100a+10b+c-495=100c+10b+a$. Simplifying this equation, we get $99a-99c=495$, or $a-c=5$. \n\nWe can use this information to solve for $a$ and $c$. We know that $a+c=17-b$, so substituting $a-c=5$ gives $2a=22-b$, or $a=\\frac{22-b}{2}$. We also know that $a^2+c^2=109-b^2$, so substituting $a=\\frac{22-b}{2}$ and $c=17-a-b$ gives $\\left(\\frac{22-b}{2}\\right)^2+(17-a-b)^2=109-b^2$. Expanding and simplifying this equation gives $2b^2-68b+325=0$, which factors as $(b-5)(2b-65)=0$. Since $b$ is a digit, we have $b=5$.\n\nSubstituting $b=5$ into $a=\\frac{22-b}{2}$ and $c=17-a-b$ gives $a=8$ and $c=4$.

So we can substitute y = minimum number of coins into the equation above: \n\n0.05x = 3.15 - 0.25(minimum number of coins)\n0.05x = 3.15 - 0.25(x + y)\n0.05x = 3.15 - 0.25(x + minimum number of coins)\n\nNow we can try each answer choice for the minimum number of coins and see which one gives a whole number solution for x: \n\n- If minimum number of coins = 0, then 0.05x = 3.15, which doesn't give a whole number solution for x. \n- If minimum number of coins = 1, then 0.05x = 2.90, which also doesn't give a whole number solution for x. \n- If minimum number of coins = 2, then 0.05x = 2.65, which gives x = 53. This means the diver brought 53 copper coins and (total number of coins - 53) brass coins. \n- If minimum number of coins = 3, then 0.05x = 2.40, which doesn't give a whole number solution for x. \n- If minimum number of coins = 4, then 0.05x = 2.15, which doesn't give a whole number solution for x. \n\nSo the answer is (C) 2.", "pred_strict": "C", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "C"}

Find the distance between X nda Y.\nChoices: (A)144km (B)72 km (C)126km (D)84 km (E)48km\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the distance between X and Y be d. Let the time it takes for Allen and Bob to meet for the first time be t. Then, we know that:\n\n- Allen travels a distance of d in time t at a speed of 54 kmph, so d = 54t.\n- Bob travels a distance of d in time t at a speed of 78 kmph, so d = 78t.\n- When they meet for the first time, the total distance they travel is d, so the total time it takes is t = d / (54 + 78) = d / 132.\n\nNow, let's consider the second part of the journey. Allen travels from Y back to X, a distance of d, at a speed of 54 kmph. Bob travels from X to Y, a distance of d + 48 km (since he covers 48 km more than Allen), at a speed of 78 kmph. Let the time it takes for them to meet for the second time be s. Then, we know that:\n\n- Allen travels a distance of d in time s at a speed of 54 kmph, so d = 54s.\n- Bob travels a distance of d + 48 km in time s at a speed of 78 kmph, so d + 48 = 78s.\n\nWe can substitute the first equation into the second equation to eliminate d:\n\n- 54s + 48 = 78s\n- 24s = 48\n- s = 2\n\nSo it takes 2 hours for Allen and Bob to meet for the second time.

The total distance they travel is 108 + 156 = 264 km, which is twice the distance between X and Y. Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 264 / 2 = 132 km.

The only digit that works for E is 1, since any other digit would result in a product that ends in a digit other than D. So we have:\n\nM A D\nB 1\n-------------\nM A D\nR A 1\n-------------\nA M I D\n\nNow we can use the fact that E times the first row must equal the second row to solve for B and R. We have:\n\nE * D = D, so E = 1\nE * A + B = A, so B = (A - E*A) = A/2\nE * M + A + R = D, so R = D - E*M - A = D - M - A\n\nSubstituting these values into the multiplication table, we get:\n\nM A D\nA/2 1\n-------------\nM A D\nD - M - A  A  1\n-------------\nA M I D\n\nNow we can use the fact that the last row must be the sum of the first two rows multiplied together. We have:\n\nD * 1 = D\nI = A + A/2 = 3A/2\nM = A * (D - M - A) = AD - AM - A^2\nA = A^2 + AM + AD + A/2\n\nSimplifying the last equation, we get:\n\n2A^2 + 4AM + 4AD + A = 0\n\nDividing by 2 and factoring out an A, we get:\n\nA(2A + 4M + 4D + 1) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be 0, we must have:\n\n2A + 4M + 4D + 1 = 0\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for I, we get:\n\nI = 3A/2 = -2M - 2D - 1\n\nNow we can substitute these values back into the multiplication table to get:\n\nM A D\nA/2 1\n-------------\nM A D\nD - M - A  A  1\n-------------\nA M -2M-2D-1 I D\n\nWe can simplify this to:\n\nM A D\nA/2 1\n-------------\nM A D\nD - M - A  A  1\n-------------\nA M -2M-2D-1 3A/2 D\n\nNow we can use the fact that the first column multiplied by D must equal the last column to solve for M. We have:\n\nM * D = D, so M = 1\n\nSubstituting this back into the multiplication table, we get:\n\n1 A D\nA/2 1\n-------------\n1 A D\nD - 1 - A  A  1\n-------------\nA 1 -2-2D-1 3A/2 D\n\nNow we can use the fact that the second row multiplied by A must equal the third row to solve for D. We have:\n\nA * 1 + 1 = 3A/2, so D = 2A + 2\n\nSubstituting this back into the multiplication table, we get:\n\n1 A 2A+2\nA/2 1\n-------------\n1 A 2A+2\n2 - A  A  1\n-------------\nA 1 -2-4A 3A/2 2A+2\n\nNow we can use the fact that the last row must be the sum of the first two rows multiplied together.

To take advantage of the discount, the merchant would need to pay $20,000 * 0.96 = $19,200 within 30 days. This means they would need to borrow $19,200 for n days. \n\nTo find the highest simple interest rate they can afford to borrow at, we can use the formula I = Prt, where I is the interest, P is the principal (amount borrowed), r is the interest rate, and t is the time in years. We can assume that n is in days, so we need to convert it to years by dividing by 365.\n\nLet's say the merchant can afford to pay back the loan in 60 days (which is less than the 30 days for the discount). Then they would need to borrow $19,200 for 60/365 years. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nI = Prt\nr = I/Pt\nr = (20,000 - 19,200)/(19,200 * 60/365)\nr = 0.24767 or 24.767%\n\nSo the highest simple interest rate they can afford to borrow at is 24.767%, which is option (A).", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "A"}

Then we have:\n\n$L(x,y) = a+b+c$\n$R(x,y) = p+q$\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are not both integers, we have $a < x \\leq a+1$ and $b < y \\leq b+1$. Adding these inequalities, we get $a+b < x+y \\leq a+b+2$. Since $c = \\lfloor x+y \\rfloor$, we have $a+b \\leq c \\leq a+b+1$. \n\nSimilarly, we have $p < 2x \\leq p+1$ and $q < 2y \\leq q+1$. Adding these inequalities, we get $p+q < 2x+2y \\leq p+q+2$. Since $R(x,y) = p+q$, we have $p+q \\leq R(x,y) \\leq p+q+1$. \n\nPutting everything together, we have:\n\n$L(x,y) = a+b+c \\geq a+b+(a+b) = 2(a+b) > p+q$\n$L(x,y) = a+b+c \\leq a+b+c+1 \\leq (a+b+1)+(a+b+1) = 2(a+b+1) < p+q+1$\n$R(x,y) = p+q \\leq R(x,y) \\leq p+q+1 < 2(a+b+1) \\leq L(x,y)$\n\nTherefore, we must have $L(x,y) > R(x,y)$, and the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ L(x,y) < R(x,y)}$.", "pred_strict": "D", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "D"}

Then Jack completes 8 units of work (two-thirds of 12), leaving 4 units of work for Jill. \n\nJill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate, which means her rate is (1/20) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour.

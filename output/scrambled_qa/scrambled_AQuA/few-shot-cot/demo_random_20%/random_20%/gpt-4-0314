In this time, the angle of elevation changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. Using the tangent function, we can write the following equations:\n\ntan(45\u00b0) = h / (d - x)\ntan(60\u00b0) = h / (d - x - x)\n\nwhere h is the height of the tower and d is the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower.\n\nSolving for h in the first equation, we get h = d - x. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\ntan(60\u00b0) = (d - x) / (d - 2x)\n\nSolving for x, we get x = d(\u221a3 - 1) / 2.\n\nSince the car travels x distance in 10 minutes, it will travel the remaining distance (d - x) in the same amount of time multiplied by the ratio of the remaining distance to x:\n\nTime = 10 * (d - x) / x = 10 * (d - d(\u221a3 - 1) / 2) / (d(\u221a3 - 1) / 2) = 10 * (2 - (\u221a3 - 1)) = 10(3 - \u221a3)\n\nSo the car will reach the base of the tower in 10(3 - \u221a3) minutes.

We can rewrite the equation M - N + 396c = 990 as (100b + 10a + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990. This simplifies to 90b - 90a + 495c = 990. Dividing by 9, we get 10b - 10a + 55c = 110. This further simplifies to b - a + 5c = 11.\n\nNow, we know that b > a, so the smallest possible value for b - a is 1. Since b and a are digits, the largest possible value for b - a is 9. We can now test values for b - a and see how many values of M are greater than 300.\n\nIf b - a = 1, then 5c = 10, which means c = 2. In this case, M = 312 and N = 213, so there is 1 value of M greater than 300.\n\nIf b - a = 2, then 5c = 9, which has no integer solutions for c. So there are no values of M greater than 300 in this case.\n\nIf b - a = 3, then 5c = 8, which means c = 8/5, which is not an integer. So there are no values of M greater than 300 in this case.\n\nIf b - a = 4, then 5c = 7, which has no integer solutions for c. So there are no values of M greater than 300 in this case.\n\nIf b - a = 5, then 5c = 6, which means c = 6/5, which is not an integer. So there are no values of M greater than 300 in this case.\n\nIf b - a = 6, then 5c = 5, which means c = 1.

Since the ages are in arithmetic progression, the sum of the ages can be represented as Sn = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where a is the age of the youngest member (7 years) and d is the common difference (3 months or 0.25 years). We are given that Sn = 250.\n\nSo, 250 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.25). Simplifying this equation, we get 500 = n * (14 + 0.25n - 0.25). Further simplification gives 500 = 14n + 0.25n^2 - 0.25n. Rearranging the terms, we get 0.25n^2 - 13.75n + 500 = 0.\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation for n. Using the quadratic formula, we get n = (13.75 \u00b1 \u221a(13.75^2 - 4*0.25*500)) / (2*0.25). Solving for n, we get two possible values: n \u2248 20.02 and n \u2248 19.98.\n\nSince the number of members must be an integer, we can conclude that there are 20 members in the club.

Now, let's find out how much work y men working y hours per day can do in y days. Since the work done is directly proportional to the number of men, hours per day, and days, we can set up a proportion: (y * y * y) / (x * x * x) = work done by y men / x^3 units. Solving for the work done by y men, we get work done by y men = (y^3 / x^3) * x^3 = y^3 units. So, the answer is (B) y3/x2 units.", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "B"}

The ratio of their investments is 40,000(12) : 60,000(12 - x) : 120,000(x). Since C's share of the profit is 150,000 out of a total profit of 375,000, his share is 2/5 of the total profit.

We are given that x^2 - y^2 = 256000 and x + y = 1000. We can rewrite the first equation as (x + y)(x - y) = 256000. Since x + y = 1000, we have 1000(x - y) = 256000. Dividing both sides by 1000, we get x - y = 256. Now we have a system of equations:\n\nx + y = 1000\nx - y = 256\n\nAdding the two equations, we get 2x = 1256, so x = 628. Substituting this back into the first equation, we get 628 + y = 1000, so y = 372. The numbers are 628 and 372. The answer is (B).", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "B"}

We have the following system of equations:\n\n20x + 25y = 340 (since she got $3.40)\nx + y = n (where n is the total number of coins)\n\nWe want to minimize x, so we can try different values for x and see if they satisfy the equations. \n\nIf x = 0, then 25y = 340, which has no integer solution for y.\nIf x = 1, then 20 + 25y = 340, which simplifies to 25y = 320, and y = 320/25 = 12.8, which is not an integer.\nIf x = 2, then 40 + 25y = 340, which simplifies to 25y = 300, and y = 300/25 = 12, which is an integer.\n\nSo the minimum number of copper coins is 2.

The total area of the walls, including doors and windows, is 2x * 5x = 10x^2 square meters. Since 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows, the area to be papered is 10x^2 - 15 sq.m. \n\nThe cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260, and the paper is 50 cm wide and costs Rs. 2 per meter. So, the total length of paper used is 260 / 2 = 130 meters. Since the paper is 50 cm wide, the area covered by the paper is 130 * 0.5 = 65 sq.m. \n\nNow, we have the equation 10x^2 - 15 = 65.

Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to that of silver, the volume of aluminum is half the total volume, or 112.5\u03c0 mm^3. The weight of aluminum in the coin is 30 grams / 3 = 10 grams, since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. Therefore, the density of aluminum is 10 grams / 112.5\u03c0 mm^3.\n\nThe volume of the new coin is given by the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(15^2)(1) = 225\u03c0 mm^3. To find the weight of the new coin, we can multiply the volume by the density of aluminum: (225\u03c0 mm^3)(10 grams / 112.5\u03c0 mm^3) = 20 grams. The answer is (B) 20 grams.", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "B"}

So, their difference (2272 - 875 = 1397) is also divisible by N. Since N is a 3-digit number and 1397 is a 4-digit number, the only possible value for N is 1397 / 1 = 1397. The sum of the digits of N is 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20. However, this is not one of the answer choices. \n\nWe made an error in assuming that N must divide 1397. Instead, we should find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2272 - R and 875 - R. Since their difference is 1397, we can find the GCD of 2272 and 875.

A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only time the customer bought it. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?\n\nLet x be the original price of the item. After the 22% discount, the price becomes 0.78x. Then, after the $20 coupon, the customer pays 0.78x - 20.\n\nWe know that the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so we can set up the equation:\n\n0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90\n\nSolving for x, we get x = $67.40.

After covering a quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to a speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?\" \n\nLet's start by finding the total distance traveled by the train. We know that distance = rate x time, so distance = 100 miles/hour x 10 hours = 1000 miles. \n\nNext, we need to find the distance traveled before the rain started. Since the train covers a quarter of the distance at its original speed, it travels 1/4 x 1000 miles = 250 miles before the rain starts. \n\nNow we need to find the time it takes to travel the remaining distance at the slower speed of 75 miles/hour. Let's call this time \"t\". We know that distance = rate x time, so 750 miles = 75 miles/hour x t. Solving for t, we get t = 10 hours. \n\nTherefore, the total journey duration is 10 hours (before the rain) + 10 hours (after the rain) = 20 hours.

What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period?\n\nTo find the average for the entire 22-month period, we need to know the total number of microwave ovens sold during that time.

If we exclude the highest and lowest scores, then the sum of the remaining scores is (yz - h - l). Substituting for h, we get:\n\nyz - (2x - l) - l = yz - 2x\n\nThe number of scores we are averaging is z - 2 (since we are excluding the highest and lowest scores). Therefore, the average score of the class excluding the highest and lowest scores is:\n\n(yz - 2x)/(z - 2)\n\nThe answer is (D).", "pred_strict": "D", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "D"}

Since x is a random number between 0 and 100, we can write:\n\nE(y) = (1/101) * (0 + sqrt(1) + sqrt(2) + ... + sqrt(100))\n\nWe can approximate this sum using the midpoint rule for numerical integration:\n\nE(y) \u2248 (1/101) * (sqrt(1/2) + sqrt(3/2) + ... + sqrt(201/2))\n\nE(y) \u2248 (1/101) * (2/3 * (2^(3/2) - 1) + 4/3 * (3^(3/2) - 2^(3/2)) + ... + 200/3 * (200^(3/2) - 199^(3/2)))\n\nE(y) \u2248 7.48\n\nSo the expected value of y is approximately 7.48.

To increase the monthly sales to $1500, the shop needs to increase its sales by $1500 - $525 = $975. Since the increase is 3 times the current sales, the shop needs to increase its sales by 300%. This means the new monthly sales should be 4 times the current sales, or $525 * 4 = $2100. \n\nTo find the total annual sales needed to achieve this, we multiply the new monthly sales by 12: $2100 * 12 = $25,200. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the total annual salary of S, which is the sum of a fixed amount and 5% of the total annual sales.

Mr. Brown takes 8 days and Mr. Black takes 12 days, so together they take 1/8 + 1/12 = 5/24 of the contract per day. Therefore, it will take them 24/5 = 4.8 days to complete the contract together.\n\nNow, we know that Mr. Brown works for 6 days and Mr. Black works for 8 days before Mr. Brown leaves. During this time, they complete 6(1/8 + 1/12) + 8(1/8) = 1.5 portions of the contract. This means that 1 - 1.5 = -0.5 portions of the contract are left for Mr. Blue to complete.\n\nSince Mr. Blue is working alone, he completes 1/3 of the contract per day. Therefore, he needs to work for 1.5/ (1/3) = 4.5 days to complete the remaining portion of the contract.\n\nAdding this to the 8 days that Mr. Black worked, we get a total of 12.5 days. However, we need to add the 6 days that Mr. Brown worked before leaving, so the total number of days it takes to complete the contract is 18.5 days. Therefore, it will take Mr. Beul 18.5 - 8 - 6 = 4.5 days to complete the contract after Mr. Brown leaves. The answer is (E).", "pred_strict": "E", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "D"}

What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla and not undersized?\n\nLet's say there are 100 chocolates in total. Let's also say that x is the number of cocoa chocolates and y is the number of vanilla chocolates. Then we know that x + y = 100.\n\nWe also know that 10% of the cocoa chocolates are overfilled, so 0.1x chocolates are overfilled. That means 0.9x chocolates are not overfilled.\n\nOut of the chocolates that are not overfilled, 90% are undersized. So 0.9(0.9x) = 0.81x chocolates are not overfilled and undersized.\n\nThat means the number of cocoa chocolates that are not overfilled and undersized is 0.81x. We want to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla and not undersized, which is y + (1 - 0.81x).\n\nSubstituting x + y = 100, we get y + (1 - 0.81x) = 100 - 0.81x.\n\nWe don't know x yet, but we do know that the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla and not undersized is the same as the percentage of chocolates that are cocoa and not overfilled and undersized. So we want to find the value of x that makes 100 - 0.81x equal to the percentage of chocolates that are cocoa and not overfilled and undersized.\n\nWe know that 10% of the cocoa chocolates are overfilled, so 90% are not overfilled. Out of the chocolates that are not overfilled, 90% are not undersized. So the percentage of chocolates that are cocoa and not overfilled and undersized is 0.9(0.9x) = 0.81x.\n\nSetting 100 - 0.81x equal to 0.81x, we get 100 = 1.62x, so x = 61.73.\n\nNow we can find y = 100 - x = 38.27.\n\nThe percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla and not undersized is y + (1 - 0.81x) = 38.27 + (1 - 0.81(61.73)) = 38.27 + 1 = 39.27.\n\nSo the answer is approximately 39%, which is closest to (C) 5%.", "pred_strict": "C", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "D"}

We know that each book can be represented by either a single letter or a pair of letters. Since there are only 26 letters in the alphabet, we need to find the minimum number of unique letters or pairs of letters that can represent all 10 types of books.\n\nLet's start by considering the case where each book is represented by a single letter. In this case, we would need at least 10 unique letters to represent all 10 types of books. However, we are told that each book can also be represented by a pair of letters. This means that we can use combinations of letters to represent each book, which gives us more options.\n\nTo minimize the number of unique letters or pairs of letters needed, we want to find the smallest set of letters or pairs of letters that can be combined to represent all 10 types of books. One way to do this is to group the books into categories based on their first letter or pair of letters. For example, we can group the books as follows:\n\n- Books starting with \"a\": represented by the letter \"a\"\n- Books starting with \"b\": represented by the letter \"b\"\n- Books starting with \"c\": represented by the letter \"c\"\n- Books starting with \"d\": represented by the pair \"de\"\n- Books starting with \"e\": represented by the pair \"ef\"\n- Books starting with \"f\": represented by the pair \"fg\"\n- Books starting with \"g\": represented by the pair \"gh\"\n- Books starting with \"h\": represented by the pair \"hi\"\n- Books starting with \"i\": represented by the pair \"ij\"\n- Books starting with \"j\": represented by the pair \"jk\"\n\nUsing this grouping, we can see that we only need 3 unique letters or pairs of letters to represent all 10 types of books: \"a\", \"b\", and any one of the pairs \"de\", \"ef\", \"fg\", \"gh\", \"hi\", \"ij\", or \"jk\".

If the minimum required amounts of E and A are to be obtained from one source, how many percent of the total budget must be allocated to satisfy the minimum required quantities of both vitamins?\n\nLet the minimum required turnover of vitamin E be $x$ and the minimum required quantity of vitamin A be $y$. Then the amount invested in vitamin E is $0.09x$ and the amount invested in vitamin A is $0.08y$. We want to find the minimum value of $k$ such that $0.09x + 0.08y \\leq 0.01k(x+y)$, which represents the minimum budget required to satisfy the minimum required quantities of both vitamins.\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get $0.01k(x+y) - 0.09x - 0.08y \\geq 0$. Factoring out $0.01$, we get $0.01(k(x+y) - 9x - 8y) \\geq 0$. Since $k(x+y) \\geq 9x + 8y$ (we need at least this much budget to satisfy the minimum requirements), we have $k(x+y) - 9x - 8y \\geq 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $k$ is $\\frac{9x+8y}{x+y}$.\n\nWe are not given the specific values of $x$ and $y$, so we cannot compute this fraction exactly. However, we can simplify it by noticing that $\\frac{9x+8y}{x+y} = \\frac{9(x+y)+(-x+8y)}{x+y} = 9 + \\frac{-x+8y}{x+y}$. Therefore, the minimum value of $k$ is $9 + \\frac{-x+8y}{x+y}$.\n\nSince we are only interested in the percentage of the total budget, we can assume without loss of generality that $x+y=100$ (i.e. the minimum required turnover of both vitamins is 100). Then the minimum value of $k$ is $9 + \\frac{-x+8y}{100} = 9 - \\frac{x-8y}{100}$. We want to maximize $\\frac{x-8y}{100}$ (since a larger numerator leads to a smaller value of $k$), subject to the constraint that $x+y=100$. This occurs when $x=8y=80$, which gives $\\frac{x-8y}{100} = -0.16$. Therefore, the minimum value of $k$ is $9 - (-0.16) = 9.16$, which is closest to $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }16.5}$.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "C"}

The question asks for the probability of the person catching the first train.\n\nAssuming that the trains run on a regular schedule and that the person arrives at the station at a random time between 5:00 and 5:02, the probability of catching the first train is the ratio of the time between 5:00 and the arrival time to the time between 5:00 and 5:02.

This is because the first year it increases by 10%, and then the second year it increases by 10% of the new, higher population, which is an additional 11%. \n\nIf the current population is x, then after one year it will be 1.1x, and after two years it will be 1.1(1.1x) = 1.21x. \n\nIf the proportion of the population that is now unemployed is y, then after two years it will be double that, or 2y. \n\nWe want to find the new proportion of the population that is unemployed, which is 2y/1.21x. \n\nTo find the percentage increase, we can take the difference between this and the original proportion (y/x), divide by the original proportion, and multiply by 100: \n\n(2y/1.21x - y/x)/(y/x) * 100% \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n(2/1.21 - 1) * 100% = 65.29% \n\nRounding to the nearest percent, the answer is (D) 65%.", "pred_strict": "D", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "D"}

Let R be the amount of money Rajun has and S be the amount of money Salas has. \n\nFrom the first sentence, we know that R + S = some number. \n\nFrom the second sentence, we know that if Salas gives $30 to Rajun, then Salas will have twice the amount of money that Rajun has. This can be written as: \n\nS - 30 = 2(R + 30) \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nS - 30 = 2R + 60 \n\nS = 2R + 90 \n\nFrom the third sentence, we know that if Rajun gives $10 to Salas, then Rajun will have the same amount of money as Salas. This can be written as: \n\nR - 10 = S \n\nSubstituting the expression we found for S in terms of R, we get: \n\nR - 10 = 2R + 90 \n\nSolving for R, we get: \n\nR = -50 \n\nThis doesn't make sense, since we can't have negative money. So we made a mistake somewhere. Let's check our work: \n\nIf R = -50, then S = 2R + 90 = -10. \n\nThis means that Rajun has -$50 and Salas has -$10, which doesn't make sense. \n\nLet's try again: \n\nR + S = some number \n\nS - 30 = 2(R + 30) \n\nS = 2R + 90 \n\nR - 10 = S \n\nSubstituting the expression we found for S in terms of R, we get: \n\nR - 10 = 2R + 90 \n\nSolving for R, we get: \n\nR = -100 \n\nThis still doesn't make sense, so let's check our work again: \n\nIf R = -100, then S = 2R + 90 = -110. \n\nThis means that Rajun has -$100 and Salas has -$110, which still doesn't make sense. \n\nWe made a mistake somewhere, but we're not sure where. Let's try a different approach: \n\nLet's use variables to represent the amounts of money that Rajun and Salas save after giving money to each other. Let x be the amount of money that Salas saves when she gives $30 to Rajun, and let y be the amount of money that Rajun saves when he gives $10 to Salas. \n\nFrom the first sentence, we know that Rajun and Salas save the same amount of money. So: \n\nx = y \n\nFrom the second sentence, we know that Salas has twice the amount of money that Rajun has after she gives him $30. This can be written as: \n\n2(x + 30) = x \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n2x + 60 = x \n\nx = -60 \n\nThis doesn't make sense, since we can't have negative money. Let's try again: \n\nx = y \n\n2(x + 30) = x \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n2x + 60 = x \n\nx = -60 \n\nThis still doesn't make sense.

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get: (width + 100) x width = 3000. Simplifying this equation, we get: width^2 + 100width - 3000 = 0. Factoring this equation, we get: (width - 50)(width + 60) = 0. Since the width cannot be negative, we know that the width is 50 feet.

Let's say the length is L and the width is W. Then we have:\n\nL x W = area\n\nWe don't know L and W, but we do know that the length of the mower is 14 feet. So each time one person mows, they cover a strip of length 14 feet and width W. After the other person mows, they cover a strip of length 14 feet and width L - W (since the first person already mowed a strip of width W). So the total area covered after two people have mowed is:\n\n14W + 14(L - W) = 14L\n\nThis means that after two people have mowed, they will have covered an area of 14L square feet. \n\nNow we need to figure out how many days it will take to cover this area if each person mows for 10 minutes per day. Let's say there are N days in total. Then each person will mow for a total of 10N minutes. We can convert this to hours by dividing by 60:\n\n10N/60 = N/6 hours\n\nSo the total amount of time spent mowing by both people is N/3 hours. \n\nWe know that the rate of mowing is 14L square feet per N/3 hours. We can convert this to a rate in square feet per hour by dividing by N/3:\n\n(14L)/(N/3) = 42L/N square feet per hour\n\nWe want to find the value of N that makes this rate equal to the area of the field divided by the total time spent mowing:\n\n(42L/N) = (LW)/(N/3)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n126L = NW\n\nWe don't know L or W, but we do know that the area of the field is 500 (since we're mowing from 1 to 500). So we have:\n\nLW = 500\n\nSubstituting this into the previous equation, we get:\n\n126L = 500/W\n\nLW = 500\n\n126L = 500/W\n\nSolving for W in the second equation, we get:\n\nW = 500/(126L)\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n42L/N = 500/(42L)\n\nSolving for L, we get:\n\nL = sqrt(500/6) = 10sqrt(15/3)\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for W, we get:\n\nW = 500/(126L) = 5sqrt(3/15)\n\nNow we can find the total time it takes to mow the field:\n\nN = (LW)/(42L/N) = (500)/(42L/N) = (500)/(42(10sqrt(15/3))/(126)) = 71\n\nSo it will take 71 days for the two people to mow the field.

We know that the cost of a newspaper on Sunday is $4 and the cost on the rest of the days is $1. So the hotel pays $4 x 2 = $8 for each Sunday newspaper and $1 x 5 = $5 for each newspaper on the rest of the days. We can set up an equation to represent the total cost of newspapers per week: \n\n$8x + $5(6x) = $210 \n\nwhere x is the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Sunday and 6x is the number of newspapers it buys on the rest of the days (since there are 6 rest of the days in a week). \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: \n\n$8x + $30x = $210 \n\n$38x = $210 \n\nx = 5.526 \n\nSince we can't buy a fraction of a newspaper, we round up to the nearest whole number and get that the hotel buys 6 newspapers on Sunday. \n\nNow we can find out how many newspapers it buys on Monday. We know that the hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does on the rest of the days, so it buys 6/2 = 3 newspapers on the rest of the days. Therefore, the total number of newspapers it buys per week is: \n\n6 (Sunday) + 3 x 6 (rest of the days) = 24 \n\nAnd the number of newspapers it buys on Monday is: \n\n24 - 6 (Sunday) = 18 \n\nThe answer is (D) 60.", "pred_strict": "D", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "A"}

If we unscramble the words, we get: \"A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on vegetables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was...\" \n\nLet's solve for the number of people who attended the picnic. If each person had contributed equally, then the cost per person would have been Rs. 96 divided by the number of people who attended. But since four people did not turn up, the remaining people had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. So we can set up the equation: \n\n(Rs. 96) / (number of people who attended) + Rs. 4 = (Rs. 96) / (number of people who were supposed to attend) \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n(Rs. 96) / (number of people who attended) + Rs. 4 = (Rs. 96) / (number of people who attended + 4) \n\nMultiplying both sides by the denominators, we get: \n\nRs. 96 + Rs. 4(number of people who attended) = Rs. 96(number of people who attended + 4) \n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get: \n\n4(number of people who attended) = 384 \n\nSo the number of people who attended the picnic was 96.

The area of the square is the side length squared, so we need to find the square root of 459 to get the side length.

Train A travels at 40 km/hr for 11 hours, so it covers a distance of 440 km. Train B travels at 72 km/hr for 2 hours, so it covers a distance of 144 km.\n\nNow we can set up an equation to find when the two trains will meet. Let's say they meet after t hours. Then the distance Train A travels in t hours plus the distance Train B travels in t hours must equal the total distance between them, which is 440 + 144 = 584 km.\n\nDistance traveled by Train A in t hours = 40t\nDistance traveled by Train B in t hours = 72t\n\nSo we have the equation: 40t + 72t = 584\nSimplifying, we get: 112t = 584\nSolving for t, we get: t = 5.2 hours\n\nThis means the two trains will meet 5.2 hours after they started traveling towards each other. Since Train A started at 11 am, and it traveled for 5.2 hours, it will meet Train B at 4:12 pm. Therefore, the two trains will meet at 4:12 pm on the same day.

We are told that if each of the 6 blocks contributes equally to the overall speed of the rotation, then the speed would be 6.24 km/hr with an additional contribution from block R. This means that the combined speed of blocks A, I, O, N, G, and Z is 6.24 - R.\n\nWe are also told that if R were removed, the speed would be 6 km/hr. This means that the combined speed of blocks A, I, O, N, G, and Z without R is 6.\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n\n(6.24 - R) - 6 = R\n0.24 = 2R\nR = 0.12\n\nNow we know the speed contribution of block R, and we can use it to find the number of employees in the rotation. Each employee covers a distance of 0.12 km in one hour (since they cover one block in one hour). To cover a full rotation of 6 blocks, they need to travel 0.72 km in one hour.\n\nThe total number of employees needed to cover the rotation is therefore:\n\n500 m / 0.72 km = 694.44\n\nRounding up to the nearest whole number, we get 695 employees.

If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?\"\n\nLet x be the number of yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it also had x white golf balls at the beginning of the day. \n\nAt the end of the day, the store had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, so it had 0.2(600) = 120 golf balls left. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, the 120 remaining golf balls must have been yellow. \n\nTherefore, the store had x yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day, and sold x/2 yellow golf balls during the day. The total number of yellow golf balls sold is therefore x/2, and this must be equal to 480 (since the store sold all of its white golf balls, which means it sold half of its total inventory of golf balls). \n\nSolving for x, we get x = 960.

Another train N leaves station B at 7 am and reaches station A at 10:30 am. At what time do the two trains cross each other?\n\nTrain M travels for 4 hours and Train N travels for 3.5 hours. Let's assume they meet after x hours of Train N's journey. Then, Train M would have traveled for (4-x) hours. \n\nWe know that the distance traveled by both trains is the same. Let's call this distance \"d\". \n\nUsing the formula distance = rate x time, we can set up two equations: \n\nd = (rate of Train M) x (4-x)\nd = (rate of Train N) x (3.5 - x)\n\nWe also know that the rates of the two trains add up to the total distance divided by the total time: \n\n(rate of Train M) + (rate of Train N) = d / (4 + 3.5)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n(rate of Train M) + (rate of Train N) = d / 7.5\n\nWe can now solve for one of the rates in terms of the other: \n\n(rate of Train M) = (d / 7.5) - (rate of Train N)\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get: \n\nd = ((d / 7.5) - (rate of Train N)) x (4-x)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nd = (4/3) x (rate of Train N) x (x-2)\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get: \n\n(4/3) x (rate of Train N) x (x-2) = (rate of Train N) x (3.5 - x)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nx = 7/3\n\nSo the two trains cross each other after 7/3 hours, or 2 hours and 20 minutes. \n\nTo find the time, we add this to the time Train N left station B: \n\n7:00 am + 2 hours and 20 minutes = 9:20 am \n\nThe answer is not among the choices given.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "", "GT": "D"}

When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Nacerdil is shifted to right by 2 places, there are 6 children between Radha and Nacerdil. How many children are there in the row?\"\n\nLet's start by finding the total number of children in the row. We know that Radha is 6th from the right end, so there are 5 children to her right. We also know that Nacerdil is 12th from the left end, so there are 11 children to her left. Therefore, the total number of children in the row is 5 + 11 + 1 (for Radha and Nacerdil) = 17.\n\nNow let's consider what happens when Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places and Nacerdil is shifted to the right by 2 places. This means that Radha moves from the 6th position to the 4th position, and Nacerdil moves from the 12th position to the 14th position. There are now 6 children between them, so there are 3 children between Radha and the 4th position, and 2 children between Nacerdil and the 14th position.\n\nWe can now count the number of children in the row by adding up the number of children to the left of Radha (3), the number of children between Radha and Nacerdil (6), and the number of children to the right of Nacerdil (2).

Since 30% of the 10 units is sand, we have 3 units of sand and 7 units of clay. \n\nLet's say we remove x units of the mixture and replace it with x units of pure sand. After the replacement, we still have 10 units of the mixture.

The decoded question is: \"Two ants are moving from their farm towards each other. At A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and at B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour. If the distance are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B?\" \n\nWe can use the formula distance = rate x time to solve this problem. Let's call the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B \"x\". \n\nSince the ants are moving towards each other, we can add their speeds to get the combined speed: \n\n9 cm/hr + 6 cm/hr = 15 cm/hr \n\nWe know that the total distance between the ants is 75 cm, and we want to find the distance that ant A travels before they meet. Let's call the time it takes for them to meet \"t\". \n\nUsing the formula distance = rate x time, we can set up an equation: \n\nx = 9 cm/hr * t \n\nWe can also set up an equation for the distance that ant B travels: \n\n75 cm - x = 6 cm/hr * t \n\nNow we can solve for \"t\" by setting these two equations equal to each other: \n\n9 cm/hr * t = 75 cm - x = 6 cm/hr * t \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n3 cm/hr * t = 75 cm \n\nt = 25 hours \n\nNow we can plug in \"t\" to find the distance that ant A travels: \n\nx = 9 cm/hr * t = 9 cm/hr * 25 hr = 225 cm \n\nTherefore, the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B is 225 cm.

Of the imaginary revenue, 1/3 was from the sales of science fiction. The company's revenue from the sales of mysteries was proportional to that of science fiction. How many times its revenue was the sales of science fiction from the sales of biography?\n\nLet x be the revenue from the sales of biography. Then the revenue from the sales of science fiction is (1/3)(1/2)(x) = x/6, and the revenue from the sales of mysteries is also x/6. Therefore, the total revenue from the three categories is x + x/6 + x/6 = 4x/3.\n\nSince 34 percent of the actual revenue came from the sales of novels, the revenue from the sales of biography is 66 percent of the actual revenue. Therefore, x is 66 percent of 0.66 times the actual revenue, or x = 0.66(0.66)(actual revenue) = 0.4356(actual revenue).\n\nThe ratio of the revenue from the sales of science fiction to the revenue from the sales of biography is (x/6)/x = 1/6. Therefore, the revenue from the sales of science fiction is 1/6 times the revenue from the sales of biography, or (1/6)(0.4356)(actual revenue) = 0.0726(actual revenue).\n\nSo the answer is 0.0726, which is approximately 1.3.

Together, they can construct 1/40 + 1/45 of the wall in one minute. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 1800. So, 1/40 + 1/45 = 113/1800.

This means that if the merchant pays within 30 days, they can take a 4% discount. The \"n\" in the terms represents the number of additional days the merchant has to pay the full amount. To find the highest simple interest rate at which he can borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount, we need to find the effective interest rate of not taking the discount and compare it to the interest rate he can borrow at.\n\nIf the merchant does not take the discount, they will have to pay the full amount of $20,000 after 30 + n days. The effective interest rate of not taking the discount can be calculated using the formula:\n\nEffective interest rate = (1 + (r/n))^n - 1\n\nwhere r is the annual interest rate and n is the number of times interest is compounded per year. Since we don't know the compounding period, we can assume it is monthly and use n = 12.\n\nEffective interest rate = (1 + (r/12))^12 - 1\n\nIf the merchant takes the discount, they will only have to pay $20,000 * (1 - 4%) = $19,200 after 30 days. To find the highest simple interest rate at which he can borrow money to take advantage of the discount, we can use the formula:\n\nSimple interest = Principal * Rate * Time\n\nwhere Principal is the amount borrowed, Rate is the interest rate, and Time is the number of days the money is borrowed for.\n\n$19,200 = Principal + Principal * Rate * (n - 30)/365\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nPrincipal * Rate * (n - 30)/365 = $800\n\nRate = $800 / (Principal * (n - 30)/365)\n\nTo maximize the interest rate, we need to minimize the Principal. The smallest possible Principal is $19,200, which would mean borrowing the full amount needed to pay the invoice after the discount period has expired. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nRate = $800 / ($19,200 * (n - 30)/365)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nRate = 0.0425n - 1.275\n\nTo find the highest possible rate, we need to maximize the right-hand side of this equation. This occurs when n = 365, which gives:\n\nRate = 14.67%\n\nTherefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can borrow money to take advantage of the discount is 14.67%.

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of minimum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin made of pure silver if its size is twice as large as minimum?\n\nFirst, we need to find the volume of the coin made of minimum. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since the diameter is given as 15 mm, the radius is 7.5 mm. The height is given as 2 mm. So the volume of the coin made of minimum is:\n\nV_min = \u03c0(7.5 mm)^2(2 mm) = 352.5 mm^3\n\nSince the volume of minimum in the alloy equals that of silver, the volume of the coin made of pure silver that is twice as large as minimum is:\n\nV_silver = 2V_min = 705 mm^3\n\nNow we can use the density of silver, which is 10.5 g/cm^3, to find the weight of the coin made of pure silver:\n\ndensity = mass / volume\nmass = density x volume\n\nConverting mm^3 to cm^3, we get:\n\nV_silver = 0.705 cm^3\n\nmass = 10.5 g/cm^3 x 0.705 cm^3 = 7.3825 g\n\nRounding to the nearest gram, the answer is (A) 36 grams.", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "B"}

This means that 3/8 of the numbers are odd and 5/8 of the numbers are even. If 9 is subtracted from each even number, then the ratio becomes 5:3 (since odd numbers are not affected). This means that 5/8 of the numbers are now equal to the original odd numbers, and 3/8 of the numbers are equal to the new even numbers (which are 9 less than the original even numbers). \n\nLet's say that there are a total of x numbers. Then we can set up the following equation: \n\n5/8 * x = 3/8 * (x/2) \n\nThe reason we divide x/2 for the even numbers is because we know that there are half as many even numbers as there are total numbers. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n5x = 9(x/2) \n\nSolving for x, we get x = 18. \n\nSo there are 18 numbers in total. Since the ratio of odd to even numbers is 3:5, there are 3/8 * 18 = 6 odd numbers and 5/8 * 18 = 12 even numbers. \n\nIf 9 is subtracted from each even number, then the new even numbers are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. \n\nSo the final list of numbers is: \n\n1, 3, 5, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 \n\nThe smallest number in this list is 0.

The total time it takes Jill to finish the work is the sum of the time it takes her to align the work and the 12 hours it takes to paint the artifact. So the total time is 20x + 12. We want to find x, so we can solve for it using the fact that Jill takes 50% longer than Jack to finish the work. This means that 20x + 12 = 1.5x, or x = 8.

There are 100 integers in S that are divisible by 10. \n\nTherefore, the number of integers in S that are not relatively prime to 1,000 is 500 + 200 - 100 = 600. \n\nThe number of integers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000 is therefore 1,000 - 600 = 400. \n\nThe probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is 400/1,000 = 2/5.

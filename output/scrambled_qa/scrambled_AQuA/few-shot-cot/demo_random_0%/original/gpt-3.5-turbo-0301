During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?\nChoices: (A)15 (B)16 (C)17 (D)18 (E)19\nAnswer:", "output": "Let x be the number of toys made by Alex and y be the number of toys made by Jacob. We know that x + y = 35 and 7x + 9y = total number of hours worked by both of them. Since both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that their total number of hours worked is approximately the same. So we can set 7x + 9y = k(35), where k is some constant. Simplifying, we get 7x + 9y = 35k. We know that x + y = 35, so we can solve for y in terms of x: y = 35 - x. Substituting this into the equation 7x + 9y = 35k, we get 7x + 9(35 - x) = 35k. Simplifying, we get 2x = 35k - 315, which means x = (35k - 315) / 2. Since x is the number of toys made by Alex, it must be an integer. This means that 35k - 315 must be even. The only value of k that satisfies this condition is k = 9. So x = 12 and y = 23. Therefore, Jacob made 23 toys. The answer is (E).", "pred_strict": "E", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "A"}

Find the area of the sheet.\nChoices: (A)1584 (B)1120 (C)792 (D)1320 (E)1200\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the length and width of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$, respectively. When folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48cm, so the length of each part is $24 - w/2$. Similarly, when folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 66cm, so the width of each part is $33 - l/2$. \n\nSince each part is half the size of the original rectangle, we can set up the equation: \n\n$(24 - w/2)(33 - l/2) = lw$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get: \n\n$792 - 33w/2 - 12l + wl/2 = lw$\n\nRearranging, we get: \n\n$lw/2 - 33w/2 - 12l + 792 = 0$\n\nUsing Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we can add 396 to both sides to get: \n\n$lw/2 - 33w/2 - 12l + 1188 = 396$\n\n$(l/2 - 33)(w/2 - 12) = 396$\n\nSince $l$ and $w$ are both positive, we can see that $l/2 - 33$ and $w/2 - 12$ must have the same sign. We can also see that $l/2 - 33$ and $w/2 - 12$ are both integers that multiply to 396. The only pairs of factors of 396 that have the same sign are 4 and 99, and 6 and 66. \n\nIf $l/2 - 33 = 4$ and $w/2 - 12 = 99$, then $l = 74$ and $w = 222$, which doesn't work since the perimeter of the original rectangle would be 592. \n\nIf $l/2 - 33 = 6$ and $w/2 - 12 = 66$, then $l = 78$ and $w = 156$. The area of the rectangle is $lw = 78 \\cdot 156 = 12,\\!168$, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }1200}$.", "pred_strict": "E", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "B"}

Find the average speed of the plane around the field?\nChoices: (A)384 (B)562 (C)458 (D)156 (E)452\nAnswer:", "output": "The average speed of the plane around the field is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. Since the plane flies along the four sides of a square, the distance traveled is 4 times the length of one side of the square. Let's assume the length of one side of the square is x km. Then the total distance traveled is 4x km.\n\nThe time taken to travel each side of the square is given by distance/speed. So the time taken to travel the four sides are x/200, x/400, x/600, and x/800 hours. The total time taken is the sum of these times, which is x/200 + x/400 + x/600 + x/800 hours.\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the plane around the field is:\n\n(4x km) / (x/200 + x/400 + x/600 + x/800) hours\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n(4x km) / [(3x/800) hours]\n\n= (3200/3) km/hr\n\n\u2248 1066.67 km/hr\n\nRounding off to the nearest whole number, the average speed of the plane around the field is 1067 km/hr.

Then, the number of students who are members of the swim team (including those who are also in the chess club) is 0.8(x + 24) = 0.8x + 19.2. We want to find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team, which is (x + 0.8x + 24)/100 = 0.24 + 0.88x/100. We can solve for x by setting this expression equal to the percentage we want to find, say \"p\": \n\n0.24 + 0.88x/100 = p/100 \n\n0.88x/100 = (p - 24)/100 \n\nx = 100(p - 24)/88 \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x into the expression we found for the number of students who are members of the swim team: \n\n0.8x + 19.2 = 0.8(100(p - 24)/88) + 19.2 = 0.91p - 1.09 \n\nSo the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is 0.91p - 1.09.

So he invested for (12-x)/12 months. We know that C's share of the profit is Rs.150,000, so his share of the profit for (12-x)/12 months would be (12-x)/12 * (120,000/220,000) * 375,000 = Rs.225,000 - Rs.181,818 = Rs.43,182.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n(12-x)/12 * (120,000/220,000) * 375,000 = Rs.43,182\n(12-x)/12 = 0.202\n12-x = 2.424\nx = 9.576\n\nSo C joined after 9.576 months, which is approximately 10 months.

We know that $a+b+c=17$ and $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$. We also know that $100a+10b+c-495=100c+10b+a$, or $99a-99c=495$, which simplifies to $a-c=5$. \n\nWe can use this information to solve for $a$ and $c$ in terms of $b$. From $a+b+c=17$, we have $a=17-b-c$. Substituting into $a-c=5$, we get $(17-b-c)-c=5$, which simplifies to $a=12-b$. \n\nNow we can substitute $a=12-b$ into $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$ to get $(12-b)^2+b^2+c^2=109$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $2b^2-24b+35=0$. This quadratic factors as $(b-5)(2b-7)=0$, so $b=5$ or $b=\\frac{7}{2}$. Since $b$ must be a digit, we have $b=5$. \n\nNow we can use $a=12-b$ and $a-c=5$ to find $a$ and $c$. We have $a=7$ and $c=2$. Therefore, the three digit number is $abc=725$.

In alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which does not simplify. \n\nTo find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z, we need to first find the total amount of zinc and copper in the mixture. \n\nFor alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper means that for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts of copper. So in 40 grams of alloy X, there are:\n\n- (2/5) * 40 = 16 grams of zinc\n- (3/5) * 40 = 24 grams of copper\n\nFor alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper means that for every 7 parts of zinc, there are 11 parts of copper. So in 60 grams of alloy Y, there are:\n\n- (7/18) * 60 = 23.33... grams of zinc\n- (11/18) * 60 = 36.66... grams of copper\n\nIn total, the mixture contains:\n\n- 16 + 23.33... = 39.33... grams of zinc\n- 24 + 36.66... = 60.66... grams of copper\n\nThe ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is therefore:\n\n- 39.33... : 60.66...\n- Simplifying by dividing both sides by 0.66..., we get:\n- 59 : 91\n\nThe answer is (D).", "pred_strict": "D", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "B"}

What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?\nChoices: (A)4 (B)3 (C)2 (D)1 (E)0\nAnswer:", "output": "Let's say the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins. Then we know that:\n\n- The value of x copper coins is 20x cents.\n- The value of y brass coins is 25y cents.\n- The total value of all the coins is 340 cents.\n\nSo we can write the equation:\n\n20x + 25y = 340\n\nWe also know that the minimum number of copper coins she brought is desired, so we want to minimize x. We can start by trying some values of y:\n\n- If y = 0, then 20x = 340, which means x = 17. This is not a whole number, so we can't have y = 0.\n- If y = 1, then 20x + 25 = 340, which means 20x = 315, which means x = 15.75. Again, not a whole number.\n- If y = 2, then 20x + 50 = 340, which means 20x = 290, which means x = 14.5. Still not a whole number.\n- If y = 3, then 20x + 75 = 340, which means 20x = 265, which means x = 13.25. Not a whole number.\n- If y = 4, then 20x + 100 = 340, which means 20x = 240, which means x = 12. This is a whole number!\n\nSo the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 12. To check, we can plug in x = 12 and y = 4 into the equation:\n\n20(12) + 25(4) = 240 + 100 = 340\n\nSo it works! The answer is (A) 4.", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "C"}

Since $[x]$ and $[y]$ are integers, $[x]+[y]$ is also an integer. Therefore, $L(x,y)$ is an integer. On the other hand, $[2x]$ and $[2y]$ are also integers, so $[2x]+[2y]$ is an integer. However, $[x+y]$ may or may not be an integer, so $R(x,y)$ may or may not be an integer.\n\nLet's consider the case where $x$ and $y$ are both integers. Then $[x+y]=x+y$, so $L(x,y)=2x+2y$ and $R(x,y)=2x+2y$. Therefore, $L(x,y)=R(x,y)$ in this case.\n\nNow let's consider the case where $x$ and $y$ are not integers. Since $[x]$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, we have $x-1<[x]\\leq x$. Similarly, $y-1<[y]\\leq y$ and $x+y-1<[x+y]\\leq x+y$. Adding these three inequalities, we get $2x+2y-3<[x]+[y]+[x+y]\\leq 2x+2y$. Therefore, $L(x,y)$ is either $2x+2y-2$ or $2x+2y-1$.\n\nOn the other hand, since $x$ and $y$ are not integers, we have $2x-2<[2x]\\leq 2x-1$ and $2y-2<[2y]\\leq 2y-1$. Adding these two inequalities, we get $4x+4y-6<[2x]+[2y]\\leq 4x+4y-2$. Therefore, $R(x,y)$ is either $4x+4y-6$, $4x+4y-5$, $4x+4y-4$, or $4x+4y-3$.\n\nWe can now consider all possible cases:\n\nCase 1: $L(x,y)=2x+2y-2$. In this case, we must have $R(x,y)=4x+4y-6$ or $R(x,y)=4x+4y-5$. However, we can easily find values of $x$ and $y$ such that $L(x,y)=2x+2y-2$ and $R(x,y)=4x+4y-4$ (for example, $x=0.1$ and $y=0.6$), so this case is possible.\n\nCase 2: $L(x,y)=2x+2y-1$. In this case, we must have $R(x,y)=4x+4y-4$, $R(x,y)=4x+4y-3$, or $R(x,y)=4x+4y-2$.

Then, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$$0.25(0.4x) - y = -10$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$0.1x - y = -10$$\n\nWe also know that the total number of people who preferred red cars is equal to the total number of women who took the survey plus the number of men who took the survey and preferred red cars. We can set up the following equation:\n\n$$0.6x + 0.75(0.4x) = 0.9x$$\n\nWe know that the total number of people who preferred red cars is equal to the total number of people who took the survey minus the number of people who preferred green cars. We can set up the following equation:\n\n$$0.9x = x - y$$\n\nNow we have three equations with three variables.

So the total revenue from selling 500 bags of ice is 500 * $1.50 = $750. The total cost of buying 500 bags of ice is 500 * $1.25 = $625. So the total profit is $750 - $625 = $125.

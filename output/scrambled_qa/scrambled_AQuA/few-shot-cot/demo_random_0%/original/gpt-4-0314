What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?\nChoices: (A)226 (B)230 (C)240 (D)260 (E)280\nAnswer:", "output": "The yearly production cost is 420 units/month * 12 months/year * $110/unit = $554,400/year. To guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the revenue from sales must be at least $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800. Since the company produces and sells 420 units/month * 12 months/year = 5,040 units/year, the minimum selling price per component is $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234.13. Since the selling price must be an integer, the minimum selling price is $235. However, this option is not available in the choices, so we must have made an error.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem. We want the profit per component to be at least $626,400 / 5,040 units = $124.29. Since the production cost is $110 per component, the minimum selling price per component is $110 + $124.29 = $234.29. Again, since the selling price must be an integer, the minimum selling price is $235. However, this option is not available in the choices.\n\nWe made an error in our calculation of the required profit per component. We should have divided the required yearly profit by the number of units produced per year, not the number of units produced per month. The correct calculation is $626,400 / (420 units/month * 12 months/year) = $124. So the minimum selling price per component is $110 + $124 = $234. Since the selling price must be an integer, the minimum selling price is $234. However, this option is not available in the choices.\n\nWe made an error in our calculation of the required profit per component. We should have divided the required yearly profit by the number of units produced per year, not the number of units produced per month.

So, each of them decided to contribute 96/x. Since 4 of them did not turn up, the remaining x-4 friends had to contribute 4 extra each. So, the new contribution per person is 96/(x-4) = 96/x + 4. \n\nMultiplying both sides by x(x-4), we get:\n96x = 96(x-4) + 4x(x-4)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n4x^2 - 16x = 0\n\nFactoring, we get:\n4x(x-4) = 0\n\nSo, x = 0 or x = 4. Since x cannot be 0, the number of friends who decided to go on the picnic is 4. Since 4 of them did not turn up, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 4 - 4 = 0.

The sum of an arithmetic series is given by Sn = n/2(a + l), where Sn is the sum of the series, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. In this case, Sn = 250, a = 7, and the common difference d = 3/12 = 0.25 years. We can find the last term using the formula l = a + (n - 1)d.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the sum formula, we get 250 = n/2(7 + l). We can rewrite this equation as n(7 + l) = 500. Now we need to find the value of n that satisfies this equation.\n\nWe can try different values of n and see if they satisfy the equation. For example, if n = 18, then l = 7 + (18 - 1)(0.25) = 11.25. This gives us 18(7 + 11.25) = 330, which is not equal to 500. If n = 20, then l = 7 + (20 - 1)(0.25) = 11.75. This gives us 20(7 + 11.75) = 375, which is also not equal to 500.\n\nIf n = 25, then l = 7 + (25 - 1)(0.25) = 13. This gives us 25(7 + 13) = 500, which is equal to 500.

In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?\nChoices: (A)15 (B)28 (C)30 (D)53 (E)59\nAnswer:", "output": "If there were 64 water lilies initially, then it would take 6 doubling periods (since $2^6=64$) less time for the lake to be fully covered. Since each doubling period takes 2 days, it would take $60-6(2)=60-12=48$ days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies. However, this answer is not in the choices. We can see that the problem states that the number of lilies doubles every two days, so we can divide the number of days by 2 to find the number of doubling periods. In this case, $48/2=24$ doubling periods. Since there were 64 lilies initially, we can find how many lilies there would be after 24 doubling periods: $64*2^{24}=2^{30}$. Now, we can find how many more doubling periods it would take for the lake to be fully covered: $2^{30}/2^{24}=2^6=64$. Since each doubling period takes 2 days, it would take $64*2=128$ days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if there were initially 64 lilies.

We are also given that $100a+10b+c-495=100c+10b+a \\Rightarrow 99a-99c=495 \\Rightarrow a-c=5$. Since $a,b,c$ are digits, we know that $a,c \\leq 9$. Thus, the only possible values for $(a,c)$ are $(9,4),(8,3),(7,2),(6,1)$. We can eliminate $(9,4)$ since that would make $a+b+c>17$. We can also eliminate $(7,2)$ since that would make $a^2+b^2+c^2<109$. Thus, we are left with $(a,c)=(8,3),(6,1)$. If $(a,c)=(8,3)$, then $b=6$ and $a^2+b^2+c^2=64+36+9=109$, which works.

We are given that $x^2 - y^2 = 256000$ and $x + y = 1000$. We can rewrite the first equation as $(x+y)(x-y) = 256000$. Since we know that $x+y = 1000$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $1000(x-y) = 256000$. Dividing both sides by 1000, we get $x-y = 256$.

At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.\nChoices: (A)144km (B)72 km (C)126km (D)84 km (E)48km\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the distance between X and Y be D km. \n\nWhen they meet for the first time, the sum of the distances covered by Allen and Bob is D. Let the distance covered by Allen be A km and the distance covered by Bob be B km. So, A + B = D. \n\nThe ratio of their speeds is 54:78, which simplifies to 27:39. Since the time taken by both to meet for the first time is the same, the ratio of the distances covered by them is also 27:39. So, A/B = 27/39, which means A = (27/66) * D and B = (39/66) * D.\n\nWhen they meet for the second time, Allen has covered A + (48 - A) = 48 km and Bob has covered B + 48 km. The sum of the distances covered by Allen and Bob when they meet for the second time is 2D. So, 48 + B + 48 = 2D, which means D = 48 + B.\n\nSubstituting the value of B from the first equation, we get D = 48 + (39/66) * D. Solving for D, we get D = 72 km. \n\nSo, the distance between X and Y is 72 km. The answer is (B).", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "E"}

Since x and y are positive real numbers, their fractional parts must be in the range (0,1). We can divide this range into two subintervals: (0, 0.5) and (0.5, 1).\n\nCase 1: {x} and {y} are both in the range (0, 0.5). In this case, {x} + {y} is in the range (0, 1), so [x + y] = [x] + [y].

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?\nChoices: (A)50 (B)70 (C)75 (D)100 (E)125\nAnswer:", "output": "Since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, there are 250 * 0.5 = 125 files infected by a virus. Let x be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Then, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5x. Since all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both, we have x + 2.5x + 125 = 250. Solving for x, we get x = 25. Therefore, there are 25 files infected by both a virus and a worm, and 2.5 * 25 = 62.5 files infected only by a worm. Since there are 250 files in total, there are 250 - 25 - 62.5 = 162.5 files not infected by a worm. However, since the number of files must be an integer, we can round up to 163 files.

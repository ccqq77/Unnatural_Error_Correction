Since the ages are in arithmetic progression, the sum of the ages is given by the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)d)$, where $a$ is the first term (the age of the youngest member) and $d$ is the common difference. In this case, $a = 7$ years and $d = 0.25$ years (3 months). We are given that $S_n = 250$ years.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get $250 = \\frac{n}{2}(14 + (n-1)(0.25))$. Simplifying, we get $500 = n(14 + 0.25n - 0.25)$. This simplifies to $500 = n(13.75 + 0.25n)$, or $2000 = 4n(55 + n)$.\n\nNow, we can try plugging in the answer choices for $n$ and see which one satisfies the equation.

It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What is the length of the space shuttle?\"\n\nTo find the length of the space shuttle, we need to determine how far it travels in 5 seconds. Since it can travel 700m in 40 seconds, its speed is 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s. In 5 seconds, it will travel 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5m. However, this includes both the length of the shuttle and the distance it travels vertically in 5 seconds. To find the vertical distance it travels in 5 seconds, we can use the proportion: (700m / 40s) = (x / 5s), where x is the vertical distance. Solving for x, we get x = 87.5m.

We know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, 70 miles away from it. So, the total time of his trip is (x/70) + (x/90) - 3 hours.\n\nWe can set up the equation: (x/70) + (x/90) - 3 = (x - 70)/70. To solve for x, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions: (9x + 7x - 1890)/630 = (9x - 630)/630. This simplifies to 16x - 1890 = 9x - 630.

The area of the walls is $15$ sq.m more than the cost of the paper, which is $260 \\div 2 = 130$ sq.m. So, the area of the walls is $130 + 15 = 145$ sq.m. \n\nSince the paper is $50$ cm wide, the length of the paper needed for the walls is $145 \\div 0.5 = 290$ meters. The cost of the paper is $290 \\times 2 = 580$ sR. \n\nThe area of the walls is equal to the height of the room multiplied by the semi-perimeter, so $145 = 2x \\times 5x$.

If he borrows money at an interest rate of x% per year, he would need to pay back $19,200 * (1 + x/100) after 30 days. Since he wants to take advantage of the discount, he would need to pay back $20,000 after 30 days. So, $19,200 * (1 + x/100) = $20,000.\n\nDividing both sides by $19,200, we get 1 + x/100 = 20,000/19,200 = 1.0416667. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get x/100 = 0.0416667. Multiplying both sides by 100, we get x = 4.16667.\n\nHowever, this is the interest rate for 30 days. To find the annual interest rate, we can use the formula (1 + x/100)^12 = 1 + r/100, where r is the annual interest rate. Plugging in x = 4.16667, we get (1 + 0.0416667)^12 = 1 + r/100.

Now, let's analyze the expressions for $L(x,y)$ and $R(x,y)$.\n\n$L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] = [x] + [y] + [([x] + \\{x\\}) + ([y] + \\{y\\})] = [x] + [y] + [x+y]$\n\n$R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] = [2([x] + \\{x\\})] + [2([y] + \\{y\\})] = [2x] + [2y]$\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of the fractional parts of $x$ and $y$.

We can find this using complementary probability: the probability that neither Alan nor Peter answers correctly, or both answer correctly, and subtracting this from 1.\n\nThe probability that neither Alan nor Peter answers correctly is (4/5)*(1/6) = 4/30. The probability that both answer correctly is (1/5)*(5/6) = 1/6. So the probability that either neither or both answer correctly is (4/30) + (1/6) = 9/30.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is 1 - 9/30 = 21/30 = 7/10. However, this is not one of the answer choices, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's try a different approach.\n\nWe can find the probability that Alan answers correctly and Peter does not, and the probability that Peter answers correctly and Alan does not, and add these probabilities together.\n\nThe probability that Alan answers correctly and Peter does not is (1/5)*(1/6) = 1/30. The probability that Peter answers correctly and Alan does not is (4/5)*(5/6) = 20/30 = 2/3. So the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is 1/30 + 2/3 = 21/30 = 7/10.\n\nAgain, this is not one of the answer choices, so we must have made another mistake in our calculations. Let's try one more approach.\n\nWe can find the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answers correctly, and subtract the probability that Roger answers correctly.\n\nThe probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answers correctly is 1 - (4/5)*(1/6) = 26/30. The probability that Roger answers correctly is 2/3. So the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is 26/30 - 2/3 = 8/30 = 4/15.\n\nThis is still not one of the answer choices, so we must have made yet another mistake in our calculations. At this point, it is unclear what the correct answer is, and we may need to reevaluate our understanding of the problem or seek help from a teacher or tutor.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "A"}

The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height (thickness). In this case, r = 7.5 mm and h = 2 mm, so the volume is V = \u03c0(7.5^2)(2) \u2248 353.43 mm^3.\n\nSince the volume of aluminum is equal to the volume of silver, each metal contributes half of the total volume, or 353.43/2 \u2248 176.72 mm^3. The problem states that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, so let the weight of aluminum be x and the weight of silver be 2x. Then, the total weight of the coin is 30 grams, so x + 2x = 30, which means x = 10 grams.\n\nNow, we need to find the weight of a coin with a diameter of 30 mm and a thickness of 1 mm made of pure aluminum. The volume of this coin is V = \u03c0(15^2)(1) \u2248 706.86 mm^3. Since the weight of aluminum is 10 grams for a volume of 176.72 mm^3, we can set up a proportion to find the weight of the new coin: 10/176.72 = w/706.86, where w is the weight of the new coin.

We are given that $a+b+c=37$ and $a=9$. We want to find the area of the rectangle, which is $bc$. Since the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37, we have $b+c=28$. Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem on the right triangle formed by the painted sides $b$ and $c$ and the unpainted side $a$. We have $a^2+b^2=c^2$, so $9^2+b^2=c^2$. We can rewrite this as $b^2=81-c^2$. Now, we can substitute $c=28-b$ into this equation to get $b^2=81-(28-b)^2$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $b^2=81-784+56b-b^2$. Adding $b^2$ to both sides and subtracting 81 from both sides, we get $56b=703$. Dividing both sides by 56, we get $b=\\frac{703}{56}$. Now, we can find $c$ by substituting this value of $b$ into the equation $c=28-b$. We get $c=28-\\frac{703}{56}=\\frac{84}{7}$.

The prime factorization of 1000 is $2^3 \\cdot 5^3$. Thus, a number is relatively prime to 1000 if it is not divisible by 2 or 5. There are 500 even numbers from 1 to 1000, and 200 numbers divisible by 5. However, we have overcounted the numbers divisible by 10, of which there are 100. So there are 500 + 200 - 100 = 600 numbers from 1 to 1000 that are not relatively prime to 1000. This means there are 1000 - 600 = 400 numbers that are relatively prime to 1000. The probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1000 is 400/1000 = 2/5. The answer is (D).", "pred_strict": "D", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "D"}

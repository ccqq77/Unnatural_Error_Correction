We are given that $\\alpha - \\theta = 15^\\circ$ and that the car is traveling at a uniform speed. This means that the ratio of the distances traveled by the car before and after the angle change is equal to the ratio of the time taken for each part of the journey. Let $t$ be the time taken for the car to travel the distance $d$ before the angle change. Then the time taken for the car to travel the distance $x$ after the angle change is $\\frac{2}{3}t$, since the angle change takes $10$ minutes out of a total journey time of $15$ minutes.\n\nUsing the formula $\\tan(a-b) = \\frac{\\tan a - \\tan b}{1 + \\tan a \\tan b}$, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\tan (\\alpha - \\theta) &= \\frac{\\tan \\alpha - \\tan \\theta}{1 + \\tan \\alpha \\tan \\theta} \\\\\n\\tan 15^\\circ &= \\frac{\\frac{h}{d+x} - \\frac{h}{d}}{1 + \\frac{h^2}{d(d+x)}} \\\\\n\\tan 15^\\circ &= \\frac{hd}{(d+x)(d+h)} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\tan 15^\\circ (d+x)(d+h) &= hd \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} - 2}(d+x)(d+h) &= hd \\\\\n(d+x)(d+h) &= hd(\\sqrt{3} - 2) \\\\\nd^2 + (2x+h)d + hx &= hd(\\sqrt{3} - 2) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe know that $d = 20t$ and $x = \\frac{2}{3}d = \\frac{40}{3}t$.

Then we pulled out another 20 marbles, of which 1 was black, and put all 20 back in. \n\nSince the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, we know that 1 out of 20 marbles is black, or 5%. \n\nWe also know that the first 20 marbles pulled out were all white, so the bag originally had at least 20 white marbles. \n\nTherefore, the total number of marbles in the bag must be at least 20 (white marbles) + 1 (black marble) = 21. \n\nThe answer choices are all much larger than 21, so we need to keep analyzing. \n\nLet's consider what would happen if the bag had exactly 21 marbles. We pull out 20 marbles and put them back in, so the bag still has 21 marbles. Then we pull out another 20 marbles, of which 1 is black, and put all 20 back in. This means that the bag now has 2 black marbles and 19 white marbles, which is not consistent with the statement that 5% of the marbles are black. \n\nTherefore, the bag must have more than 21 marbles.

He replaces 15% of it with milk, which means he adds 15 mL of milk and has 85 mL of tea left. He repeats this process again, so he adds another 15% of milk to the 85 mL of tea, which means he adds 12.75 mL of milk and has 72.25 mL of tea left. Finally, he replaces 10% of this solution with more milk, which means he adds 7.225 mL of milk and has 65.0275 mL of tea left.\n\nTo find the final concentration of tea, we need to find the ratio of tea to the total solution. The total solution is 100 mL + 15 mL + 12.75 mL + 7.225 mL = 135.975 mL. So the ratio of tea to the total solution is 65.0275 mL / 135.975 mL = 0.478 or 47.8%.\n\nHowever, we need to remember that John started with 50% strong tea, so we need to multiply our answer by 50% to get the final concentration of tea. 0.478 * 50% = 23.9% or 23.86% (rounded to two decimal places).

Let's assume that each side has a length of 1 unit (the actual unit doesn't matter as long as we use the same unit consistently). \n\nThe time it takes to travel each side is equal to the length of the side divided by the speed. So the time it takes to travel the first side at 200 km/hr is 1/200 hours. The time it takes to travel the second side at 400 km/hr is 1/400 hours. The time it takes to travel the third side at 600 km/hr is 1/600 hours. The time it takes to travel the fourth side at 800 km/hr is 1/800 hours. \n\nThe total time it takes to travel around the square is the sum of these times: \n\n1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800 \n\nWe can find a common denominator for these fractions by multiplying them all together: \n\n(1/200)(1/400)(1/600)(1/800) = 1/384000000 \n\nSo the sum of the fractions is: \n\n1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800 = (96 + 48 + 32 + 24)/38400 = 200/38400 = 1/192 \n\nThe average speed is equal to the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

So the total time taken is: \n\n4(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800) = 4(1/192) = 1/48 \n\nTherefore, the average speed is: \n\n4/ (1/48) = 192 km/hr \n\nThe answer is (A).", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "A"}

Let the number be represented by abcde. Then its square is (abcde)^2 = a^2b^2c^2d^2e^2. When a 1 is added after its square, we get a^2b^2c^2d^2e^2 + 1. When a 1 is added before the number, we get 1abcde. \n\nAccording to the problem, we have the equation: \n\na^2b^2c^2d^2e^2 + 1 = 3(1abcde) \n\nExpanding the terms on the right side, we get: \n\na^2b^2c^2d^2e^2 + 1 = 300000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e \n\nSince the left side is one more than a multiple of 3, the right side must also be one more than a multiple of 3.

Therefore, the number of cubes that remain painted is 25 - 9 = 16. Since there are 6 faces to the cube, the total number of cubes that remain painted is 16 x 6 = 96. However, we need to subtract the cubes that are painted on both faces where they meet at the edges. There are 4 edges on each face, and each edge has 3 cubes that are painted on both faces.

(suAmse the redro of letters in a pair does not matter.)\nChoices: (A)3 (B)4 (C)5 (D)10 (E)20\nAnswer:", "output": "There are 10 different types of books, so we need at least 10 different codes. Each code can be either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If we use only single letters, we can only have 26 different codes. If we use pairs of letters, we can have $\\binom{26}{2} = 325$ different codes. However, we need to subtract the 10 pairs of identical letters (e.g. AA, BB, CC, etc.) since each type of book can only be uniquely represented by either a single letter or a pair of different letters. So we have $325 - 10 = 315$ different codes using pairs of letters. \n\nSince we need at least 10 different codes, we can use 9 single letters and 1 pair of letters. The number of ways to choose 2 letters out of 9 is $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$. So the total number of codes we can create is $9 + 36 = 45$.

At what time illw the two trains emet each other?\nChoices: (A)12 am on the next day (B)5 am on the next day (C)5 pm on the next day (D)2 pm on the next day (E)None of these\nAnswer:", "output": "Train A starts at 11 am and travels for 3 hours before Train B starts. In those 3 hours, Train A covers a distance of 40 kmph * 3 hours = 120 km. Let's call this point where Train A reaches after 3 hours Point X. Now, both trains are traveling towards each other. The relative speed between the two trains is 72 kmph + 40 kmph = 112 kmph. The distance between Point X and Lucknow is the distance that both trains need to cover before they meet. Let's call this distance D. The time it takes for both trains to meet is D / 112. \n\nTrain A has been traveling for a total of 3 + (D / 112) hours. Train B has been traveling for a total of (D / 112) hours. We know that Train B started at 2 pm, which is 3 hours after Train A started. So the total time that Train A has been traveling is 3 + (D / 112) + 3 = (D / 112) + 6. \n\nWe also know that Train A travels at a speed of 40 kmph. So the distance it covers in (D / 112) + 6 hours is 40 * ((D / 112) + 6) km. Similarly, Train B travels at a speed of 72 kmph. So the distance it covers in (D / 112) hours is 72 * (D / 112) km. \n\nSince both trains are traveling towards each other, the sum of the distances they cover is equal to the total distance between Point X and Lucknow, which is D. So we can write the equation: \n\n40 * ((D / 112) + 6) + 72 * (D / 112) = D \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n40D / 112 + 240 + 72D / 112 = D \n\n112D = 112 * 240 \n\nD = 240 km \n\nSo the two trains will meet after traveling a distance of 240 km from Mumbai Central. The time it takes to cover this distance at a relative speed of 112 kmph is 240 / 112 hours, which is approximately 2.14 hours. \n\nTrain A started at 11 am and traveled for 3 hours before Train B started. So the total time it takes for Train A to reach the meeting point is 3 + 2.14 = 5.14 hours. Therefore, the two trains will meet at 4:08 pm (11 am + 5 hours and 8 minutes).

The smallest possible value for x that gives us a whole number for the minimum number of coins is x = 2 (since 0.20x is a multiple of 0.20 and 13.60 is a multiple of 0.25).

Let's assume they meet x hours after Train M leaves City A. Then, Train M has traveled 5x km and Train N has traveled 7x km.

Then we have 2L + 2W = 340, which simplifies to L + W = 170. We also know that the boundary around the plot is 1 meter wide, so the length of the plot with the boundary is L + 2 and the width is W + 2. The area of the boundary is then (L + 2)(W + 2) - LW. Plugging in L + W = 170, we get (170 - W + 2)(W + 2) - LW = 10(170 - 2W + 4). Simplifying this equation gives us 3W^2 - 164W + 680 = 0. Solving for W using the quadratic formula gives us W = 20 or W = 22. Plugging these values back into L + W = 170 gives us L = 150 or L = 148. The area of the boundary is then (150 + 2)(20 + 2) - 150(20) = 3440. Multiplying this by the rate of 10 per square meter gives us a cost of 34400.

Since the tunnel is 1 mile long and the train takes 3 seconds to enter it, the train's length is 1 mile / 3 seconds = 1/3 miles. Therefore, the total distance the train needs to travel to pass completely through the tunnel is 1 mile + 1/3 miles = 4/3 miles. Using the formula distance = rate x time, we can solve for the time it takes the train to pass through the tunnel: (4/3) miles = (1/30) miles per second x time. Solving for time, we get time = (4/3) / (1/30) = 40 seconds. However, we need to add the initial 3 seconds it takes for the train to enter the tunnel, so the total time is 40 + 3 = 43 seconds.

In this case, $L(x,y) = x + y + \\lfloor x+y \\rfloor$ and $R(x,y) = 2x + 2y$. Since $\\lfloor x+y \\rfloor \\leq x+y$, we have $L(x,y) \\leq 3x+3y$, while $R(x,y) = 2x+2y$.

Substituting this into the second equation, we get 2L + 240/L - 10 = perimeter. To minimize the perimeter, we can take the derivative of this expression with respect to L and set it equal to 0: 2 - 240/L^2 = 0, which means L = sqrt(120). Substituting this back into the expression for the perimeter, we get 2(sqrt(120)) + 240/sqrt(120) - 10 = 58. The answer is (A).", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "A"}

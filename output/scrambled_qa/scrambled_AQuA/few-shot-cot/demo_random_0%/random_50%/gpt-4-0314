The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n\nNow, let's solve the problem:\n\nLet the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45\u00b0 be x, and let the height of the tower be h. Then, we have:\n\ntan(45\u00b0) = h/x => h = x\n\nWhen the angle of elevation is 60\u00b0, the distance from the car to the base of the tower is x - vt, where v is the speed of the car and t = 10 minutes. Then, we have:\n\ntan(60\u00b0) = h/(x - vt) => h = (x - vt)\u221a3\n\nSince h = x, we have:\n\nx = (x - vt)\u221a3 => x(1 - \u221a3) = vt\u221a3\n\nNow, we want to find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower, which is when the distance from the car to the base of the tower is 0. Let this time be T. Then, we have:\n\nx - v(T + t) = 0 => x = v(T + t)\n\nDividing the two equations, we get:\n\n(1 - \u221a3) / (T + t) = \u221a3 => T + t = (1 - \u221a3) / \u221a3\n\nSince t = 10 minutes, we have:\n\nT = (1 - \u221a3) / \u221a3 - 10 = 5(\u221a3 + 1)\n\nSo, the car will reach the base of the tower after 5(\u221a3 + 1) more minutes.

If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total does the bag currently hold?\"\n\nLet x be the total number of marbles in the bag, and let y be the number of black marbles. Then, the percentage of black marbles in the bag is y/x. Since 1 black marble was pulled out the second time, the percentage of black marbles is 1/20. So, y/x = 1/20.\n\nSince all 20 marbles pulled out the first time were white, there must be at least 20 white marbles in the bag. Therefore, x - y >= 20.\n\nNow we can solve the system of equations:\n\ny/x = 1/20\nx - y >= 20\n\nWe can rewrite the first equation as y = x/20. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\nx - x/20 >= 20\n19x/20 >= 20\nx >= 400\n\nSince x must be an integer, the smallest possible value for x is 400.

What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session?\n\nFirst, we need to find the minimum number of students who attended either the prom night or the debating session. Since 45% attended the prom night and 35% took part in the debating session, at least 45% + 35% = 80% of the students participated in one of the events.\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum number of students who did not participate in either event. Since 80% of the students participated in one of the events, 100% - 80% = 20% of the students did not participate in either event.\n\nTo find the number of students, we multiply the percentage by the total number of students: 20% * 200 = 40 students.\n\nThe maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 40.

What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400?\"\n\nNow, let's solve the problem. The company produces 420 units per month, so they produce 420 * 12 = 5,040 units per year. The production cost per component is $110, so the total production cost per year is 5,040 * $110 = $554,400.\n\nTo guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the revenue from sales must be at least $554,400 (production costs) + $626,400 (desired profit) = $1,180,800.\n\nTo find the minimum selling price per component, divide the total revenue needed by the number of components produced per year: $1,180,800 / 5,040 = $234.52. Since the selling price must be a whole number, round up to $235.\n\nThe minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $235.

We are given that the average of H and L is x, so (H + L)/2 = x.

We want to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scores, which is S/(z-2).\n\nFirst, we can rewrite the equation (H + L)/2 = x as H + L = 2x. Next, we can rewrite the equation (H + L + S)/(z) = y as H + L + S = zy. Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get 2x + S = zy. We want to solve for S, so we get S = zy - 2x.\n\nNow we can find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scores, which is S/(z-2) = (zy - 2x)/(z-2).

The total number of students is a 4-digit number. Find the difference between the maximum number of students and the minimum number of students.\"\n\nLet x be the total number of students. Then, we have the following equation:\n\nx = 16a + 10b + 8c\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the number of students studying math, bio, and English, respectively.\n\nSince x is a 4-digit number, we have 1000 \u2264 x \u2264 9999.\n\nWe want to find the maximum and minimum values of x that satisfy the equation. To find the maximum value, we can set a, b, and c to be as small as possible. Since a, b, and c are integers, the smallest possible values are a = 1, b = 1, and c = 1. This gives us:\n\nx = 16(1) + 10(1) + 8(1) = 34\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest value of x that is greater than or equal to 1000. We can do this by increasing the values of a, b, and c. If we increase a to 2, we get:\n\nx = 16(2) + 10(1) + 8(1) = 50\n\nThis is still less than 1000, so we can continue increasing the values of a, b, and c. If we increase a to 63, b to 100, and c to 125, we get:\n\nx = 16(63) + 10(100) + 8(125) = 1008 + 1000 + 1000 = 3008\n\nThis is the smallest value of x that is greater than or equal to 1000.\n\nNow, we want to find the largest value of x that is less than or equal to 9999. We can do this by decreasing the values of a, b, and c. If we decrease a to 62, b to 99, and c to 124, we get:\n\nx = 16(62) + 10(99) + 8(124) = 992 + 990 + 992 = 2974\n\nThis is the largest value of x that is less than or equal to 9999.\n\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 3008 - 2974 = 34.\n\nThe answer is not in the choices, so there might be an error in the question or the choices.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "", "GT": "A"}

To find the average speed, we can use the formula: average speed = total distance / total time.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total distance. Since the airplane is flying along the four sides of a square, the total distance is the same for each side. Let's call the side length of the square x. Then the total distance is 4x.\n\nNext, we need to find the total time. To do this, we can use the formula time = distance / speed for each side of the square:\n\nTime for side 1: x / 200\nTime for side 2: x / 400\nTime for side 3: x / 600\nTime for side 4: x / 800\n\nThe total time is the sum of these times: (x / 200) + (x / 400) + (x / 600) + (x / 800).\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula for average speed:\n\nAverage speed = (4x) / [(x / 200) + (x / 400) + (x / 600) + (x / 800)]\n\nTo solve this equation, we can first cancel out the x terms:\n\nAverage speed = 4 / [(1 / 200) + (1 / 400) + (1 / 600) + (1 / 800)]\n\nNow we can find a common denominator for the fractions in the denominator, which is 2400:\n\nAverage speed = 4 / [(12 / 2400) + (6 / 2400) + (4 / 2400) + (3 / 2400)]\n\nAverage speed = 4 / [(12 + 6 + 4 + 3) / 2400]\n\nAverage speed = 4 / [25 / 2400]\n\nTo solve for the average speed, we can multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction:\n\nAverage speed = 4 * (2400 / 25)\n\nAverage speed = 384 km/hr\n\nSo the average speed of the airplane around the field is 384 km/hr.

What is that number?\"\n\nLet the 5-digit number be $abcde$. We are given that $(abcde)1 = 3(1abcde)$. This means that $100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1 = 3(100000 + 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e)$. Simplifying, we get $70000a + 9000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e = 299999$. Since $a$ is a digit, the largest possible value for the left side of the equation is $70000(9) + 9000(9) + 1000(9) + 100(9) + 10(9) = 630000$. Therefore, we can conclude that $a = 4$.\n\nNow we have $9000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e = 119999$. Since $b$ is a digit, the largest possible value for the left side of the equation is $9000(9) + 1000(9) + 100(9) + 10(9) = 99000$. Therefore, we can conclude that $b = 2$.\n\nNow we have $1000c + 100d + 10e = 39999$. Since $c$ is a digit, the largest possible value for the left side of the equation is $1000(9) + 100(9) + 10(9) = 11100$. Therefore, we can conclude that $c = 8$.\n\nNow we have $100d + 10e = 5999$. Since $d$ is a digit, the largest possible value for the left side of the equation is $100(9) + 10(9) = 990$. Therefore, we can conclude that $d = 5$.\n\nNow we have $10e = 499$.

It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm. If the outer surface of the cube is painted, how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\n\nNow, let's solve the problem. The outer surface of the hollow cube consists of 6 faces, each of size 5cm x 5cm. Since each face is made up of 1cm x 1cm smaller cubes, there are 5 x 5 = 25 smaller cubes per face. So, there are 6 x 25 = 150 smaller cubes that are painted.\n\nThe inner surface of the hollow cube consists of 6 faces, each of size 3cm x 3cm (since the thickness is 1cm). There are 3 x 3 = 9 smaller cubes per inner face, so there are 6 x 9 = 54 smaller cubes that are unpainted.\n\nThe total number of smaller cubes is 5 x 5 x 5 = 125. Since the cube is hollow, we need to subtract the number of smaller cubes that make up the thickness. There are 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 smaller cubes in the inner part of the hollow cube. So, there are 125 - 27 = 98 smaller cubes in the hollow cube.\n\nOut of these 98 smaller cubes, 54 are unpainted. So, the answer is (E) 54.", "pred_strict": "E", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "A"}

She then decides to label each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or a pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books?\n\nTo minimize the number of letters needed, Amy should first use all possible single-letter codes before moving on to two-letter codes. There are 10 types of books, so Amy will need at least 4 single-letter codes (since 3 single-letter codes can only represent 3 types of books). With 4 single-letter codes, there are 6 types of books left to label. \n\nNow, Amy needs to create two-letter codes for the remaining 6 types of books. Since she already has 4 letters, she can create 4 choose 2 = 6 two-letter codes using these letters. Therefore, Amy will need a minimum of 4 letters to create the codes for all 10 types of books.

If the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original square piece of cloth?\n\nLet the side length of the original square be x. After trimming 4 feet, the rectangle has dimensions x and x-4. Since the rectangle is cut diagonally in half, each triangle has a base of x and a height of x-4. The area of each triangle is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * x * (x-4).\n\nWe are given that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so (1/2) * x * (x-4) = 70. Simplifying, we get x^2 - 4x = 140, or x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0. Factoring, we get (x-14)(x+10) = 0. Since x must be positive, x = 14.\n\nThe perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4 * 14 = 56 feet. The answer is (A).", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "A"}

We can rewrite M and N as M = 100b + 10a + c and N = 100c + 10b + a. Then, M - N = 99b - 99c + 9a = 99(b - c) + 9a. We are given that M - N + 396c = 990, so 99(b - c) + 9a + 396c = 990. Dividing by 9, we get 11(b - c) + 44c + a = 110. Since a, b, and c are digits, we know that 0 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 9. We can now test values of c to find possible values of M.\n\nIf c = 0, then 11(b - c) + a = 110, which has no solutions since b > a.\nIf c = 1, then 11(b - c) + 44 + a = 110, which simplifies to 11(b - 1) + a = 66. The only solution is a = 0 and b = 7, so M = 710.\nIf c = 2, then 11(b - c) + 88 + a = 110, which simplifies to 11(b - 2) + a = 22.

Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n250 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.25)\n\nSolving for n, we get n = 20. The answer is (B).", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "C"}

What is the deatcnsi between A and B?\nChoices: (A)180 (B)90 (C)270 (D)360 (E)None of the above\nAnswer:", "output": "First, let's rewrite the question with the correct spelling and grammar:\n\nKniev moved from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with ease, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?\n\nLet the distance between A and B be x miles. When Kniev was 70 miles away from B, he had traveled x - 70 miles. The time it took him to travel this distance at 70 mph is (x - 70) / 70 hours.\n\nSince Kniev was 3 hours away from finishing his trip at this point, the total time for his trip is 3 + (x - 70) / 70 hours. In this time, Kniev traveled x miles to B and x miles back to A, for a total of 2x miles. His average speed for the entire trip is the total distance divided by the total time: (2x) / (3 + (x - 70) / 70).\n\nWe can use the formula for average speed: average speed = (initial speed + final speed) / 2. In this case, the initial speed is 70 mph and the final speed is 90 mph, so the average speed is (70 + 90) / 2 = 80 mph.\n\nNow we can set up an equation using the average speed and the total time:\n\n80 = (2x) / (3 + (x - 70) / 70)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 70(3 + (x - 70) / 70) to eliminate the fraction:\n\n80(70)(3 + (x - 70) / 70) = 2x\n\nSimplifying:\n\n16800 = 2x\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\nx = 8400 / 2 = 4200 / 1 = 4200\n\nSince the distance between A and B is x miles, the answer is 4200 miles.

If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z?\n\nIn alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which means there are 6 parts zinc and 9 parts copper. Since there are 40 grams of alloy X, each part weighs 40 / (6+9) = 40 / 15 = 8/3 grams. So, there are 6 * 8/3 = 16 grams of zinc and 9 * 8/3 = 24 grams of copper in alloy X.\n\nIn alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which means there are 7 parts zinc and 11 parts copper. Since there are 60 grams of alloy Y, each part weighs 60 / (7+11) = 60 / 18 = 10/3 grams. So, there are 7 * 10/3 = 70/3 grams of zinc and 11 * 10/3 = 110/3 grams of copper in alloy Y.\n\nNow, when we mix the two alloys to form alloy Z, we have 16 + 70/3 = 178/3 grams of zinc and 24 + 110/3 = 182/3 grams of copper. To find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z, we can divide both quantities by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n\n(178/3) / 2 : (182/3) / 2 = 89/3 : 91/3 = 89:91\n\nSo the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 89:91.

In this time, Train M travels a distance of $(d/4)x$ and Train N travels a distance of $(d/3.5)x$. Since they are traveling towards each other, the sum of these distances is equal to the distance between the two cities, $d$. So we have:\n\n$(d/4)x + (d/3.5)x = d$\n\nDividing both sides by $d$ and simplifying, we get:\n\n$(1/4)x + (1/3.5)x = 1$\n\nCombining the terms on the left side, we get:\n\n$(7/28)x + (4/28)x = 1$\n\n$(11/28)x = 1$\n\n$x = 28/11$\n\nConverting this to hours and minutes, we get:\n\n$x = 2 \\frac{6}{11}$ hours\n\n$x = 2$ hours and $\\frac{6}{11} \\times 60$ minutes\n\n$x = 2$ hours and $32.73$ minutes\n\nRounding to the nearest minute, we get:\n\n$x = 2$ hours and $33$ minutes\n\nSo the two trains cross each other at 5 am + 2 hours and 33 minutes = 7:33 am.

The height of the room is:\n\nFirst, we need to decode the question:\nThe height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is:\n\nLet the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5x. The perimeter of the room is 10x. The area of the paper needed is 260 / 2 = 130 sq.m. Since the paper is 50cm wide, the length of the paper needed is 130 / 0.5 = 260m. \n\nThe area of the walls, including doors and windows, is 260m * 0.5m = 130 sq.m. The area of the walls without doors and windows is 130 - 15 = 115 sq.m. \n\nSince the perimeter is 10x and the height is 2x, the area of the walls without doors and windows is 10x * 2x = 20x^2. So, 20x^2 = 115, and x^2 = 115 / 20 = 5.75. Taking the square root of both sides, x = \u221a5.75 \u2248 2.4.\n\nThe height of the room is 2x = 2 * 2.4 = 4.8m.

The only protocol to be observed is that whenever they speak, the PM should speak before the MP and the MP should speak before the MLA. In how many ways can the meeting be held?\n\nWe have 10 speakers, and we need to arrange them in such a way that the PM speaks before the MP and the MP speaks before the MLA. We can think of this as arranging the 10 speakers in a line, with the PM, MP, and MLA in that order.\n\nFirst, let's consider the 7 other speakers (not the PM, MP, or MLA). They can be arranged in 7! ways.\n\nNow, we need to insert the PM, MP, and MLA into the line. Since the PM must speak before the MP and the MP must speak before the MLA, we can think of the three of them as a single unit. There are 8 possible positions for this unit (before the first speaker, between the first and second speakers, between the second and third speakers, etc., and after the seventh speaker).\n\nSo, the total number of ways to arrange the speakers is 7! * 8 = 10! / (3! * 2!).

When Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?\n\nFirst, we find the initial positions of Radha and Neha. Since Neha is 12th from the left end, there are 11 children to her left. Similarly, since Radha is 6th from the right end, there are 5 children to her right.\n\nNow, we consider their new positions after shifting. Neha moves 2 places to the right, so she is now 14th from the left end. Radha moves 2 places to the left, so she is now 4th from the right end.\n\nSince there are 6 children between Radha and Neha in their new positions, we can find the total number of children in the row by adding the number of children to the left of Neha, the number of children between Radha and Neha, and the number of children to the right of Radha: 11 + 6 + 5 = 22.\n\nHowever, we also need to include Radha and Neha themselves in the total count, so the final answer is 22 + 2 = 24.

The corrected question is: Two ants are moving from their farms towards each other. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour. If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B?\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the formula: distance = rate \u00d7 time. Since the ants are moving towards each other, we can add their speeds together: 9 cm/hr + 6 cm/hr = 15 cm/hr. Now, we need to find the time it takes for the ants to meet. Since the farms are 75 cm apart, we can divide the total distance by their combined speed: 75 cm / 15 cm/hr = 5 hours.\n\nNow that we know the time it takes for the ants to meet, we can find the distance that ant A travels by multiplying its speed by the time: 9 cm/hr \u00d7 5 hr = 45 cm.

So the multiplication table looks like this:\n\n1 9 7\n2 8\n-------------\n1 9 7\n4 9 6\n-------------\n9 1 I 7\n\nThe only remaining option for I is 0, so the final multiplication table is:\n\n1 9 7\n2 8\n-------------\n1 9 7\n4 9 6\n-------------\n9 1 0 7\n\nSo the answer is (D) 9 2 0 7.", "pred_strict": "D", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "D"}

If the train is traveling at 120 miles an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel?\"\n\nTo find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel, we first need to find the length of the train. Since the train is traveling at 120 miles per hour, we can convert this to miles per second: 120 miles/hour * (1 hour/3600 seconds) = 1/30 miles/second.\n\nIn 3 seconds, the train enters the tunnel completely, so its length is 3 seconds * (1/30 miles/second) = 1/10 miles.\n\nNow, we need to find the total distance the train needs to travel to pass completely through the tunnel, which is the sum of the train's length and the tunnel's length: 1/10 miles + 1 mile = 11/10 miles.\n\nFinally, we can find the time it takes for the train to travel this distance by dividing the total distance by its speed: (11/10 miles) / (1/30 miles/second) = 33 seconds.\n\nSo, it will take the train 33 seconds to pass completely through the tunnel.

To find the highest simple interest rate, we can use the formula: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time. In this case, $800 = $19,200 * Rate * (30/360).

It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen?\n\nNow, let's solve the problem:\n\nSince the company promises to deliver 7200 pens and 10% of the produced pens are defective, we can find the total number of pens produced:\n\nTotal pens produced = 7200 / (1 - 0.1) = 7200 / 0.9 = 8000 pens\n\nThe company estimates a 25% profit on all the manufactured pens, so the total revenue from selling the pens is:\n\nTotal revenue = 7200 pens * Rs. 10/pen = Rs. 72000\n\nSince the profit is 25%, the total cost of producing the pens is:\n\nTotal cost = Total revenue * (1 - profit percentage) = Rs. 72000 * (1 - 0.25) = Rs. 54000\n\nNow, we can find the manufactured cost of each pen:\n\nManufactured cost per pen = Total cost / Total pens produced = Rs. 54000 / 8000 pens = Rs. 6.75\n\nSince the answer choices are in whole numbers, we can round the cost to the nearest whole number, which is Rs. 7.

We are also given that 0.5 * 250 = 125 files were not infected by a virus, so V = 125. \n\nNow we can solve for B: 125 + W - B = 250, so W - B = 125. Since W - B = 2.5B, we have 2.5B = 125, so B = 50. \n\nNow we can find the number of files not infected by a worm: 250 - (W + V - B) = 250 - (125 + 50) = 250 - 175 = 75. \n\nSo, 75 of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm.

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?\n\nNow, let's solve the problem:\n\nThe volume of the original coin is 2 * 15^2 * pi = 450pi mm^3. Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, each has a volume of 225pi mm^3. The weight of the aluminum is 30 grams / (1 + 2) = 10 grams, and the weight of the silver is 20 grams.\n\nThe density of aluminum is 10 grams / 225pi mm^3, and the density of silver is 20 grams / 225pi mm^3.\n\nThe volume of the new coin is 1 * 30^2 * pi = 900pi mm^3. Since the new coin is made of pure aluminum, its weight will be the volume multiplied by the density of aluminum: 900pi mm^3 * (10 grams / 225pi mm^3) = 40 grams.\n\nThe answer is (B) 40 grams.", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "B"}

Therefore, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2).\n\nWe can compute the first few values of f(n) as follows:\n- f(1) = 1 (since there's only one way to reach the first step)\n- f(2) = 2 (since the boy can take two one-step moves or one two-step move)\n\nNow we can compute f(n) for n = 3 to 10 using the recurrence relation:\n- f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3\n- f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 3 + 2 = 5\n- f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 5 + 3 = 8\n- f(6) = f(5) + f(4) = 8 + 5 = 13\n- f(7) = f(6) + f(5) = 13 + 8 = 21\n- f(8) = f(7) + f(6) = 21 + 13 = 34\n- f(9) = f(8) + f(7) = 34 + 21 = 55\n- f(10) = f(9) + f(8) = 55 + 34 = 89\n\nSo there are 89 ways for the boy to reach the top of the stairs.

When Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as now, so $j+s=2s$. When Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father, so $f+j=2(f-s)$. \n\nNow we have a system of three equations with three variables:\n\\begin{align*}\nj+s+f&=100 \\\\\nj+s&=2s \\\\\nf+j&=2(f-s)\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving the second equation for $j$, we get $j=s$.

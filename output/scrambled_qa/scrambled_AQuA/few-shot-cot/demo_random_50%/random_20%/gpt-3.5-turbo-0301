Let's say the train traveled x miles before it had to slow down to 75 miles/hour. Then, the remaining distance it had to cover at 75 miles/hour would be (1000 - x) miles. \n\nUsing the formula distance = rate * time, we can set up two equations: \n\nx = 100 miles/hour * t1 \n1000 - x = 75 miles/hour * t2 \n\nwhere t1 is the time it took the train to travel x miles at 100 miles/hour, and t2 is the time it took the train to travel the remaining distance at 75 miles/hour. \n\nWe can solve for t1 and t2 by dividing both sides of each equation by their respective rates: \n\nt1 = x / 100 \nt2 = (1000 - x) / 75 \n\nThe total journey duration would be the sum of t1 and t2: \n\ntotal time = t1 + t2 = x / 100 + (1000 - x) / 75 \n\nTo minimize the total time, we can take the derivative of this expression with respect to x and set it equal to 0: \n\nd/dx (x/100 + (1000-x)/75) = 1/100 - 1/75 = 0 \n\nSolving for x, we get x = 400. \n\nPlugging this value of x back into the expression for total time, we get: \n\ntotal time = 400/100 + (1000-400)/75 = 4 + 8/15 = 12.5 \n\nSo the total journey duration is 12.5 hours.

After the second replacement, he has 72.25 mL of 50% strong tea and 27.75 mL of milk. Then he replaces 10% of this solution with more milk, which means he adds 7.225 mL of milk.

Let's assume that each side has a length of 1 unit (the actual unit doesn't matter as long as we use the same unit consistently). \n\nThe time it takes to travel each side is equal to the distance divided by the speed. So the time it takes to travel the first side at 200 km/hr is 1/200 hours. The time it takes to travel the second side at 400 km/hr is 1/400 hours. The time it takes to travel the third side at 600 km/hr is 1/600 hours.

Here, we will use substitution. Solving the first equation for y, we get:\n\ny = 18 - x\n\nSubstituting into the second equation, we get:\n\nxw + (18 - x)(b + 1) = 100\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nxw + 18b - xb + x = 82\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nx(w - b) = 64 - 18b\n\nSince x and y are both positive integers, we can try different values of x and see if we get a corresponding integer value of y. If we let x = 8, then we get:\n\n8(w - b) = 64 - 18b\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n8w - 8b = 64 - 18b\n\n26b = 64\n\nb = 64/26, which is not an integer.\n\nIf we let x = 9, then we get:\n\n9(w - b) = 64 - 18b\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n9w - 9b = 64 - 18b\n\n27b = 55\n\nb = 55/27, which is not an integer.\n\nIf we let x = 10, then we get:\n\n10(w - b) = 64 - 18b\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n10w - 10b = 64 - 18b\n\n28b = 54\n\nb = 27/14, which is not an integer.\n\nIf we let x = 11, then we get:\n\n11(w - b) = 64 - 18b\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n11w - 11b = 64 - 18b\n\n29b = 53\n\nb = 53/29, which is not an integer.\n\nIf we let x = 12, then we get:\n\n12(w - b) = 64 - 18b\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n12w - 12b = 64 - 18b\n\n30b = 52\n\nb = 26/15, which is not an integer.\n\nTherefore, there is no integer solution for x and y.

Then we know that (abcde1)^2 = 3*(abced1)^2. Expanding this out, we get:\n\na^2 * 10^8 + b^2 * 10^6 + c^2 * 10^4 + d^2 * 10^2 + e^2 + 2*10^4*e + 1 = 3*(a^2 * 10^8 + b^2 * 10^6 + c^2 * 10^4 + e^2 * 10^2 + d^2 + 2*10^3*d + 1)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2*10^4*e + 2*10^3*d = 2*(a^2 * 10^8 + b^2 * 10^6 + c^2 * 10^4 - d^2 - e^2)\n\nSince the left side of the equation is even, the right side must also be even. This means that d and e must have the same parity (i.e. they are both even or both odd). We can also see that the right side of the equation is divisible by 4, so d and e must both be even.\n\nNow we can try some values for d and e. Let's start with d = 2 and e = 4.

Let's try c = 2:\n\na^2 * 10^8 + b^2 * 10^6 + 40000 = 5100\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\na^2 * 10^8 + b^2 * 10^6 = 39000\n\nWe can see that the left side of the equation is divisible by 100, so b must be even. Let's try b = 4:\n\na^2 * 10^8 + 160000 = 39000\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\na^2 = 2309\n\nThis means that a = 47. So the 5-digit number is 47284.

So there are a total of $10 + 45 = 55$ possible codes needed to represent all 10 types of books. The smallest number of letters needed to create these codes would be the smallest integer $n$ such that $\\binom{n}{1} + \\binom{n}{2} \\geq 55$. Checking values of $n$, we find that $\\binom{5}{1} + \\binom{5}{2} = 5 + 10 = 15 < 55$ and $\\binom{6}{1} + \\binom{6}{2} = 6 + 15 = 21 < 55$, but $\\binom{7}{1} + \\binom{7}{2} = 7 + 21 = 28 \\geq 55$.

Then how many values of M are more thna 300.\nChoices: (A)20 (B)30 (C)40 (D)200 (E)None\nAnswer:", "output": "Since M > N, we know that b > a and c > b. This means that M - N = (100b + 10a + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99(b - c) + 9(a - b). Since M - N + 396c = 99(b - c) + 9(a - b) + 396c = 990, we can simplify this to 11(b - c) + (a - b) + 36c = 110. Rearranging, we get 10(b - c) + (a - b + 36c) = 110.\n\nSince M is a three-digit number, we know that a > 0. If a = 1, then the maximum value of b is 9 and the minimum value of c is 2. Plugging these values into the equation above, we get 10(b - 2) + (1 - b + 36(2)) = 110, which simplifies to 35b = 572. This is not possible since b must be an integer.\n\nIf a = 2, then the maximum value of b is 9 and the minimum value of c is 3. Plugging these values into the equation above, we get 10(b - 3) + (2 - b + 36(3)) = 110, which simplifies to 35b = 638. This means that b = 18, which is not possible since b must be a single digit.\n\nIf a = 3, then the maximum value of b is 9 and the minimum value of c is 4. Plugging these values into the equation above, we get 10(b - 4) + (3 - b + 36(4)) = 110, which simplifies to 35b = 704. This means that b = 20, which is not possible since b must be a single digit.\n\nIf a = 4, then the maximum value of b is 9 and the minimum value of c is 5. Plugging these values into the equation above, we get 10(b - 5) + (4 - b + 36(5)) = 110, which simplifies to 35b = 770. This means that b = 22, which is not possible since b must be a single digit.\n\nIf a = 5, then the maximum value of b is 9 and the minimum value of c is 6. Plugging these values into the equation above, we get 10(b - 6) + (5 - b + 36(6)) = 110, which simplifies to 35b = 836. This means that b = 24, which is not possible since b must be a single digit.\n\nIf a = 6, then the maximum value of b is 9 and the minimum value of c is 7. Plugging these values into the equation above, we get 10(b - 7) + (6 - b + 36(7)) = 110, which simplifies to 35b = 902. This means that b = 26, which is not possible since b must be a single digit.\n\nIf a = 7, then the maximum value of b is 9 and the minimum value of c is 8. Plugging these values into the equation above, we get 10(b - 8) + (7 - b + 36(8)) = 110, which simplifies to 35b = 968. This means that b = 28, which is not possible since b must be a single digit.\n\nIf a = 8, then the maximum value of b is 9 and the minimum value of c is 9. Plugging these values into the equation above, we get 10(b - 9) + (8 - b + 36(9)) = 110, which simplifies to 35b = 1034.

Plugging these values into the equation above, we get 10(b - 9) + (9 - b + 36(9)) = 110, which simplifies to 35b = 1100.

We know that x = 2y (twice as many on Sunday as the rest of the week combined). We also know that the hotel spends $4x on Sunday newspapers and $1y for each of the other 6 days, so the total spent per week is 4x + 6y = $210. \n\nSubstituting x = 2y into the equation, we get 4(2y) + 6y = $210, which simplifies to 14y = $210. Solving for y, we get y = 15. So the hotel orders 15 newspapers on each of the other 6 days, for a total of 6(15) = 90 newspapers. \n\nSince x = 2y, we know that x = 2(15) = 30 newspapers on Sunday. Therefore, the hotel orders a total of 90 + 30 = 120 newspapers per week. \n\nTo find out how many newspapers are ordered on Monday specifically, we know that the hotel orders 15 newspapers on each of the other 6 days, for a total of 90 newspapers. So the remaining 30 newspapers must be ordered on Sunday and Monday combined.

However, he also needs to factor in the 20% discount, which means he needs to sell it for 1440 / 0.8 = Rs. 1800. But this is the selling price after the discount, so the original selling price would be 1800 / 1.2 = Rs. 1500. However, this is not one of the answer choices. To check which answer choice is closest, we can try plugging in each option and seeing which one gives a profit of 20%. Trying option (B), we get: \n\n- Selling price = Rs. 1875\n- Cost price = Rs. 1200\n- Profit = Selling price - Cost price = 1875 - 1200 = Rs. 675\n- Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) * 100% = (675 / 1200) * 100% = 56.25%\n\nThis is not a 20% profit, so we can eliminate option (B). Trying option (C), we get:\n\n- Selling price = Rs. 1876\n- Cost price = Rs. 1200\n- Profit = Selling price - Cost price = 1876 - 1200 = Rs. 676\n- Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) * 100% = (676 / 1200) * 100% = 56.33%\n\nAgain, this is not a 20% profit, so we can eliminate option (C). Trying option (D), we get:\n\n- Selling price = Rs. 1872\n- Cost price = Rs. 1200\n- Profit = Selling price - Cost price = 1872 - 1200 = Rs. 672\n- Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) * 100% = (672 / 1200) * 100% = 56%\n\nThis is still not a 20% profit, so we can eliminate option (D). Finally, trying option (A), we get:\n\n- Selling price = Rs. 1879\n- Cost price = Rs. 1200\n- Profit = Selling price - Cost price = 1879 - 1200 = Rs. 679\n- Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) * 100% = (679 / 1200) * 100% = 56.58%\n\nThis is also not a 20% profit, so we can eliminate option (A).

Let's call the distance that Train B travels before they meet \"x\". \n\nWhen Train B starts, the distance between the two trains is 120 km. They are both moving towards each other, so their combined speed is 40 kmph + 72 kmph = 112 kmph. \n\nUsing the formula distance = rate * time, we can set up the equation: \n\n120 km + x = 112 kmph * t \n\nwhere \"t\" is the time it takes for the two trains to meet. \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\nx = 112t - 120 \n\nWe know that Train B starts at 2 pm, which is 3 hours after Train A starts. So the time they meet is also 3 hours after Train B starts, or 5 pm. \n\nPlugging in t = 3 into our equation, we get: \n\nx = 112(3) - 120 = 216 km \n\nSo the two trains meet 216 km from Mumbai Central, which means Train A has traveled 216 km and Train B has traveled 96 km. \n\nTo find the time that Train A reaches the meeting point, we can use the formula distance = rate * time again: \n\n216 km = 40 kmph * t \n\nSolving for t, we get t = 5.4 hours. \n\nSo Train A reaches the meeting point at 4:24 pm (11 am + 5.4 hours). \n\nThe answer is not given in the choices, so the correct answer is (E) None of these.", "pred_strict": "E", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "A"}

Therefore, minor arc CD has a measure of 360\u00b0 - 150\u00b0 - 80\u00b0 = 130\u00b0. Since minor arc AD is the sum of minor arcs AC and CD, its measure is 160\u00b0 + 130\u00b0 = 290\u00b0. However, since we are looking for the measure of minor arc AD, which is a minor arc, we subtract 360\u00b0 from 290\u00b0 to get 290\u00b0 - 360\u00b0 = -70\u00b0. But since minor arc AD cannot have a negative measure, we add 360\u00b0 to get the final answer of 290\u00b0 - 360\u00b0 + 360\u00b0 = 290\u00b0.

We know that A + B + C = 17 and $A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109$. We also know that when we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number with the same digits in reverse order. This means that $ABC - 495 = CBA$. \n\nWe can rewrite this as $100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A$. Simplifying this equation, we get $99A - 99C = 495$, which means $A - C = 5$. \n\nWe can use this information to solve for A and C in terms of B. From $A + B + C = 17$, we know that $A + C = 17 - B$. Substituting $A - C = 5$, we get $2A = 22 - B$, which means $A = 11 - \\frac{B}{2}$. Similarly, $C = 6 - \\frac{B}{2}$. \n\nNow we can substitute these expressions for A and C into $A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109$ to get an equation in terms of B: $(11 - \\frac{B}{2})^2 + B^2 + (6 - \\frac{B}{2})^2 = 109$. Simplifying this equation, we get $5B^2 - 66B + 165 = 0$, which means $B = 3$ or $B = 11$. \n\nIf $B = 3$, then $A = 9$ and $C = 1$, which means the original number is 931. However, this does not satisfy the condition that $ABC - 495 = CBA$, since $931 - 495 = 436$ and $CBA$ should have digits in the reverse order. \n\nIf $B = 11$, then $A = 0$ and $C = 6$, which means the original number is 106. This does satisfy the condition that $ABC - 495 = CBA$, since $106 - 495 = 601$. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }288}$.", "pred_strict": "C", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "A"}

We know that the total amount she earned is $3.40, so we can set up the equation:\n\n0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40\n\nWe also know that the minimum number of copper coins she brought is what we're looking for, so we want to minimize x. Since we don't know the value of y, we can't solve for x directly. However, we do know that both x and y have to be integers (since they represent the number of coins).\n\nLet's try some values of y and see what happens. If y = 1, then 0.20x + 0.25 = 3.40, which means x = 13. This is not an integer, so y can't be 1. If y = 2, then 0.20x + 0.50 = 3.40, which means x = 13.

If Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, then she becomes the 14th child from the left end. So there are 13 children between Neha and Radha. Adding Radha and Neha, we get a total of 15 children. But we are told that there are 6 children between them, so we need to add 6 more children to get the total number of children in the row. Therefore, the answer is 15 + 6 = 21. However, this is not one of the answer choices, so we must have made an error in our calculations. Let's check our work. If we count the number of children from the left end up to Neha, we get 11 children. If we count the number of children from the right end up to Radha, we get 5 children. So there are 16 children in total. If we shift Neha to the right by 2 places, she becomes the 13th child from the left end. If we shift Radha to the left by 2 places, she becomes the 4th child from the right end. So there are 11 children to the left of Neha and 3 children to the right of Radha, which means there are 16 - 11 - 3 = 2 children between Neha and Radha. Adding Neha, Radha, and the 2 children between them, we get a total of 18 children. However, this is still not one of the answer choices. Let's check our work again. If we count the number of children from the left end up to Neha, we get 11 children. If we count the number of children from the right end up to Radha, we get 5 children. So there are 16 children in total. If we shift Neha to the right by 2 places, she becomes the 13th child from the left end. If we shift Radha to the left by 2 places, she becomes the 4th child from the right end. So there are 11 children to the left of Neha and 3 children to the right of Radha, which means there are 11 + 3 - 1 = 13 children between Neha and Radha (we subtract 1 because we counted Neha and Radha twice).

Then 2L + 2W = 340, which simplifies to L + W = 170. We want to find the area of the 1-meter-wide boundary around the plot, which means we need to add 2 to both the length and width. So the new length is L + 2 and the new width is W + 2. The area of the boundary is then (L + 2)(W + 2) - LW. Plugging in L + W = 170, we get (170 - W + 2)(W + 2) - LW = 172W - W^2 + 344 - LW. The cost of gardening is 10 per square meter, so the total cost is 10(172W - W^2 + 344 - LW). We want to find the sum of this expression for all possible values of W. We can rewrite the expression as -W^2 + (172 - L)W + 3440, which is a quadratic function with a maximum value. The maximum value occurs at W = (172 - L) / 2. Plugging in L + W = 170, we get W = (170 - L) / 2. Substituting this into the expression for W, we get W = (170 - L) / 2 = (172 - L) / 2, which simplifies to L = 171. Plugging this into the expression for W, we get W = (170 - 171) / 2 = -1/2, which is not a valid solution.

To take advantage of the discount, the merchant would need to pay $20,000 * 0.96 = $19,200 within 30 days. This means they would need to borrow $19,200 for 30 days. \n\nTo find the highest simple interest rate they can afford to borrow at, we can use the formula I = Prt, where I is the interest, P is the principal (amount borrowed), r is the interest rate, and t is the time in years. We know that P = $19,200 and t = 30/365 (assuming a 365-day year). We want to solve for r.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to get r = I/Pt. The interest they can afford to pay is the difference between the amount they need to pay back ($20,000) and the amount they borrowed ($19,200), which is $800. Plugging in the values, we get r = 800/(19,200*(30/365)) = 0.4275, or 42.75%. \n\nHowever, this answer is not one of the choices given.

In this case, $L(x,y) = x+y$ and $R(x,y) = 2x+2y$, so $L(x,y) \\neq R(x,y)$ unless $x=y=0$. \n\nNow suppose that $x$ and $y$ are not both integers. Let $a = \\lfloor x \\rfloor$, $b = \\lfloor y \\rfloor$, $c = \\lfloor x+y \\rfloor$, $p = \\lfloor 2x \\rfloor$, and $q = \\lfloor 2y \\rfloor$. Then we have:\n\n$L(x,y) = a+b+c$\n$R(x,y) = p+q$\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are not both integers, we have $a < x \\leq a+1$ and $b < y \\leq b+1$. Adding these inequalities, we get:\n\n$a+b < x+y \\leq a+b+2$\n\nTaking the floor of both sides, we get:\n\n$a+b \\leq c \\leq a+b+1$\n\nNow we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: $p = 2a$ and $q = 2b$.

In this case, we have:\n\n$L(x,y) = a+b+c$\n$R(x,y) = 2a+2b+2$\n\nSince $c \\geq a+b$, we have $L(x,y) \\geq 2a+2b$.\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are not both integers, we have $p \\leq 2x < p+1$ and $q \\leq 2y < q+1$. Adding these inequalities, we get:\n\n$p+q \\leq 2x+2y < p+q+2$\n\nTaking the floor of both sides, we get:\n\n$2a+2b+1 \\leq p+q \\leq 2a+2b+3$\n\nTherefore, $R(x,y) \\geq 2a+2b+1$ and $R(x,y) \\leq 2a+2b+3$. Combining this with $L(x,y) \\geq 2a+2b$, we get:\n\n$L(x,y) \\geq R(x,y)-1$\n\nIn either case, we have $L(x,y) < R(x,y)$ or $L(x,y) \\geq R(x,y)-1$, so $L(x,y) \\neq R(x,y)$.

Let x be the volume of aluminum in the alloy, then the volume of silver is also x. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of silver in the coin is 2x and the weight of aluminum is x/2. The total weight of the coin is 30 grams, so x/2 + 2x = 30, which means x = 10 grams. Therefore, the weight of aluminum in the coin is 5 grams. \n\nThe volume of the new coin is pi * (30/2)^2 * 1 = 706.86 mm^3, which means its volume is twice that of the original coin. Since the new coin is made of pure aluminum, its weight is proportional to its volume, so its weight is 2 * 5 = 10 grams. The answer is not given, but it can be found by multiplying 10 by the ratio of the weight of the new coin to its volume, which is 30/(pi * (30/2)^2 * 1) = 0.0212 grams/mm^3.

Using the fact that (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2, we can rewrite x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = 28^2 - 2xy. Since we want to maximize xy, we want to minimize (x^2 + y^2), which means we want to maximize (28^2 - 2xy). This is maximized when xy is minimized, which occurs when x and y are as close together as possible. Since x + y = 28, the values of x and y that minimize xy are x = y = 14/2 = 7.

If he finishes two-thirds of the work, then the remaining one-third of the work will take him 1/3 * 12 = 4 hours. \n\nLet's call Jill's rate of cleaning r. We know that her rate is 5% of Jack's rate, so r = 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour. \n\nTo find how long it will take Jill to finish the remaining one-third of the work, we can use the formula: \n\ntime = work / rate \n\nThe remaining one-third of the work is 1/3 of the yacht, so: \n\ntime = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours \n\nSo it will take Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining one-third of the work.

So: \n\nJ + X + 2 = 2(S - X) \n\nJ + X + 2 = 2(100 - 2J - X - X) \n\nJ + X + 2 = 200 - 4J - 2X \n\n5J + 3X = 198 \n\nNow we have two equations: \n\n5J + 2X = 200 \n\n5J + 3X = 198 \n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get: \n\nX = -2 \n\nSubstituting that back into the first equation: \n\n5J + 2(-2) = 200 \n\n5J = 204 \n\nJ = 40.8 \n\nBut we know that J has to be a whole number, so let's try J = 41: \n\n5(41) + 2X = 200 \n\n2X = 175 \n\nX = 87.5 \n\nBut X also has to be a whole number, so let's try X = 88: \n\n5(41) + 2(88) = 200 \n\nF = 2(S - X) \n\nF = 2(100 - 2J - X) \n\nF = 2(100 - 2(41) - 88) \n\nF = 50 \n\nSo Joe's father is 50 years old.

But we want to express k in terms of y. We know that m = 4ky, so k = m/(4y). Substituting that into our expression for m/x: \n\nm/x * 100 = 100k = 100(m/(4y)) = 25(m/y) \n\nSo m is 25(m/y) percent of x. But we know that x is 4y, so we can substitute that in: \n\nm/x * 100 = 25(m/y) = 25(m/(4y)) * 4 = 6.25m/y \n\nSo m is 6.25(m/y) percent of x.

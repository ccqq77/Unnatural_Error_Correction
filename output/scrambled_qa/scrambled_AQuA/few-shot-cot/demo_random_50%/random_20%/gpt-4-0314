Using the Pythagorean theorem on both triangles, we get the following equations:\n\n$x^2 + h^2 = 2h^2$ and $x^2 + h^2 = 4h^2$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get $2h^2 = x^2$.

Let the first number be x, then the other numbers are x+2, x+4, x+6, and x+8. The sum is x+(x+2)+(x+4)+(x+6)+(x+8) = 5x+20. We want this sum to be a perfect square when divided by 10, so 5x+20 = 10n^2 for some integer n. Then 5x = 10n^2 - 20 = 10(n^2 - 2). Since 5x is divisible by 5, 10(n^2 - 2) must also be divisible by 5, which means n^2 - 2 must be divisible by 5. The smallest perfect square that is 2 more than a multiple of 5 is 3^2 = 9, so n^2 - 2 = 5 and n^2 = 7. Then 5x = 10(7) = 70, and x = 14. The 5 consecutive odd numbers are 14+1, 14+3, 14+5, 14+7, and 14+9, which are 15, 17, 19, 21, and 23.

Then the speed of the plane is 10x miles per hour. Let t be the time in hours it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship. In that time, the ship travels 180 + tx miles, and the plane travels 10tx miles. So we have the equation 180 + tx = 10tx. This simplifies to 180 = 9tx, which means t = 180 / 9x. \n\nNow we can find the distance from the starting point when they meet. The distance traveled by the ship is 180 + tx = 180 + (180 / 9x)(x) = 180 + 20x. The distance traveled by the plane is 10tx = 10(180 / 9x)(x) = 200x. Since they meet at the same point, these distances are equal: 180 + 20x = 200x. This simplifies to 180 = 180x, which means x = 1.\n\nSo the speed of the ship is 1 mile per hour, and the speed of the plane is 10 miles per hour. The time it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship is t = 180 / 9x = 180 / 9(1) = 20 hours. The distance from the starting point when they meet is 180 + 20x = 180 + 20(1) = 200 miles.

Let the other integer be 11x. We are given that the LCM of 350 and 11x is 7700. Using the formula GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b, we have 11 * 7700 = 350 * 11x. Dividing both sides by 11 * 350, we get x = 2 * 22, so the other integer is 11 * 44 = 484. However, this is not one of the answer choices. \n\nWe made an error in assuming that the GCF of the two integers is exactly 11. Since the GCF is 11, the other integer must be a multiple of 11, but it could also have other factors in common with 350. We can find the prime factorization of 350 as 2 * 5^2 * 7. To find the other integer, we can multiply 11 by any combination of these prime factors. The only combination that results in an answer choice is 11 * 2 * 7 = 154, which is not one of the answer choices either.\n\nWe made another error in our calculation of the LCM. The LCM of 350 and 11x should be divisible by both 350 and 11x, but it does not have to be exactly 7700. We can find the LCM by multiplying the highest powers of all prime factors present in both numbers. The prime factorization of 7700 is 2^2 * 5^2 * 7 * 11. Since 350 has a factor of 2, the LCM must have at least one factor of 2. The only answer choice that is a multiple of 11 and has a factor of 2 is (A) 242.

Since x must be an integer, the smallest possible value of x is 1044.\n\nHowever, we need to make sure that the number of students taking physics and math are also integers. If x = 1044, then 0.2x = 208.8 and 0.28x = 292.32, which are not integers. We can try increasing x until we find a value that results in integer values for the number of students taking physics and math.\n\nIf x = 1045, then 0.2x = 209 and 0.28x = 292.6, which are still not integers.\n\nIf x = 1046, then 0.2x = 209.2 and 0.28x = 292.88, which are still not integers.\n\nIf x = 1047, then 0.2x = 209.4 and 0.28x = 293.16, which are still not integers.\n\nIf x = 1048, then 0.2x = 209.6 and 0.28x = 293.44, which are still not integers.\n\nIf x = 1049, then 0.2x = 209.8 and 0.28x = 293.72, which are still not integers.\n\nIf x = 1050, then 0.2x = 210 and 0.28x = 294, which are both integers.\n\nTherefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 1050, which is not one of the given choices.

There are 90 two-digit numbers from 10 to 99. There are 401 three-digit numbers from 100 to 500. 9 + 90(2) + 401(3) = 1392.

Find the number.\nChoices: (A)368 (B)377 (C)288 (D)997 (E)112\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the three-digit number be $100a+10b+c$. We are given that $a+b+c=17$ and $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$. We are also given that $100a+10b+c-495=100c+10b+a \\Rightarrow 99a-99c=495 \\Rightarrow a-c=5$. Now we have a system of three equations with three variables:\n\\begin{align*} a+b+c&=17 \\\\ a^2+b^2+c^2&=109 \\\\ a-c&=5 \\end{align*}\nFrom the first and third equations, we get $b=12$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $a^2+c^2=49$. Since $a-c=5$, we can try values of $a$ and $c$ that differ by 5 and see if their squares sum to 49. We find that $a=7$ and $c=2$ work. Thus, the three-digit number is $\\boxed{712}$, which is not in the answer choices.

Since there are 40 grams of alloy X, each part is 40 / (6+9) = 40 / 15 = 8/3 grams. So there are 6(8/3) = 16 grams of zinc and 9(8/3) = 24 grams of copper in alloy X.\n\nIn alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, so there are 7 parts zinc and 11 parts copper. Since there are 60 grams of alloy Y, each part is 60 / (7+11) = 60 / 18 = 10/3 grams. So there are 7(10/3) = 70/3 grams of zinc and 11(10/3) = 110/3 grams of copper in alloy Y.\n\nWhen alloy X and alloy Y are mixed to form alloy Z, there are 16 + 70/3 = 178/3 grams of zinc and 24 + 110/3 = 182/3 grams of copper in alloy Z.

How many employees are there in htta zoniairagotn?\nChoices: (A)300 (B)200 (C)400 (D)100 (E)500\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the number of employees be x. Then, the total contribution of all employees is 6 lakh, or 600,000. So, 600,000 / x = the contribution of each employee. If each employee contributed 60 extra, then the total contribution would be 6.24 lakh, or 624,000. So, 624,000 / (x + 60) = the new contribution of each employee. We can set up the equation:\n\n600,000 / x = 624,000 / (x + 60)\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n600,000(x + 60) = 624,000x\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n60,000x + 36,000,000 = 62,400x\n\n2,400x = 36,000,000\n\nx = 15,000\n\nSo there are 15,000 employees in the organization.

Let the speed of train M be m km/hr and the speed of train N be n km/hr. Then we have:\n\nmt = n(t - 2)\n\nSince train M takes 4 hours to travel between City A and City B, and train N takes 3.5 hours, we can also write:\n\n4m = 3.5n\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\nmt = n(t - 2)\n4m = 3.5n\n\nWe can solve this system by first solving the second equation for m:\n\nm = (3.5/4)n\n\nNow substitute this expression for m into the first equation:\n\n((3.5/4)n)t = n(t - 2)\n\nNow we can cancel out the n terms:\n\n(3.5/4)t = (t - 2)\n\nNow solve for t:\n\nt = 4(2 - 2/3) = 8 - 8/3 = 16/3\n\nSo the two trains cross each other 16/3 hours after 5 am, which is 1 hour and 8 minutes after 5 am.

The height fo the room is:\nChoices: (A)2.6m (B)3.9m (C)4m (D)4.2m (E)4.4m\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the height of the room be 2x meters and the semi-perimeter be 5x meters. The area of the walls, excluding doors and windows, is 15 sq.m more than the area of the paper used. The area of the paper used is 260 / 2 = 130 sq.m. So the area of the walls is 130 + 15 = 145 sq.m. Since the paper is 50 cm wide, the length of the paper used is 260 / 2 = 130 meters. The perimeter of the room is 2 * 5x = 10x meters. So the length of the paper used is equal to the perimeter of the room, which means 10x = 130, and x = 13. The height of the room is 2x = 2 * 13 = 26 meters.

According to the problem, the compound interest on both shares will be equal when they are 26 years old. So, we can write the equation:\n\nx(1 + 0.04)^3 = (5100 - x)(1 + 0.04)^2\n\nSolving for x, we get x \u2248 2600. Therefore, Mohan's share is Rs. 2600.

To find the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain, we can set up the equation (w/25)/x * t = y, where t is the time in seconds. Solving for t, we get t = yx/(w/25), which simplifies to t = 25xy/w seconds. To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60, so the final answer is t = (25xy/w)/60 = 5xy/(12w) minutes.

Now, let's find the combined rate of P and Q. If P can finish the jar in 10 minutes, his rate is 1/10 jars per minute. If Q can finish the jar in 10 minutes, her rate is 1/10 jars per minute as well. So, their combined rate is 1/10 + 1/10 = 2/10 = 1/5 jars per minute. Therefore, it would take them 5 minutes to empty the jar together.

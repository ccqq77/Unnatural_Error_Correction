In this time, the angle of elevation changes from $45^\\circ$ to $60^\\circ$. Using the tangent function, we have:\n\n$\\tan 45^\\circ = \\frac{h}{x} \\Rightarrow h = x$\n$\\tan 60^\\circ = \\frac{h}{x - d} \\Rightarrow h = (x - d)\\sqrt{3}$\n\nSince both equations are equal to $h$, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n$x = (x - d)\\sqrt{3}$\n\nNow, we want to find the time it takes for the car to travel the remaining distance $d$. Since the car is traveling at a uniform speed, we can set up a proportion:\n\n$\\frac{d}{x} = \\frac{t}{10}$\n\nWe want to find the value of $t$. First, we need to find the value of $d$. From the equation $x = (x - d)\\sqrt{3}$, we can solve for $d$:\n\n$d = x - \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{3}} = x\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$\n\nNow, we can plug this value of $d$ back into our proportion:\n\n$\\frac{x\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)}{x} = \\frac{t}{10} \\Rightarrow t = 10\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$\n\nSo the car will reach the base of the tower in $10\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$ more minutes.

Now we have two equations:\n\nd = 6s\nd = 4(s + 12)\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second, we get:\n\n6s = 4(s + 12)\n\nSolving for s, we find that s = 24.

The total time can be found by adding the time it takes to fly along each side: s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800. \n\nTo find the average speed, we can plug in these values into the formula: average speed = 4s / (s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800). Simplifying the expression, we get average speed = 4800 / (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800) = 4800 / (0.005 + 0.0025 + 0.001666... + 0.00125) \u2248 384 km/hr. \n\nThe answer is (A).", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "A"}

We are also given that $(100a+10b+c)-495 = 100c+10b+a$. Simplifying, we get $99a-99c=495$, or $a-c=5$. \n\nNow we have the system of equations: \n\\begin{align*} a+b+c&=17 \\\\ a-c&=5 \\\\ a^2+b^2+c^2&=109 \\end{align*}\n\nFrom the first two equations, we can find that $b=12$. Substituting this into the third equation, we get $a^2+c^2=1$. Since $a$ and $c$ are digits, the only possibility is $a=1$ and $c=0$.

The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula S = n(a1 + an) / 2, where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. In this case, S = 51, a1 = -50, and an = x. We can rewrite the formula as n(-50 + x) / 2 = 51. Since the integers are consecutive, we can also write x = -50 + n - 1. Substituting this expression for x into the formula, we get n(-50 + (-50 + n - 1)) / 2 = 51. Simplifying, we get n(n - 99) / 2 = 51. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get n(n - 99) = 102.

So, Sronha earns x/5 per hour and Krane earns x/4 per hour. Together, they earn (x/5 + x/4) per hour, which simplifies to (9x/20) per hour. To find out how many hours they need to work together to earn x, we can set up the equation (9x/20) * h = x, where h is the number of hours. This simplifies to 9h = 20, so h = 20/9, which is approximately 2.22 hours. The answer is (B) 2 hours.", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "C"}

We have the following equations:\n\n70x + 30y = 810\nx + y = maximum number of trousers\n\nWe want to maximize x, so we can rewrite the second equation as y = maximum number of trousers - x. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n70x + 30(maximum number of trousers - x) = 810\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n40x = 810 - 30(maximum number of trousers)\nx = (810 - 30(maximum number of trousers))/40\n\nSince x must be an integer, we can try different values for the maximum number of trousers until we find an integer value for x. If the maximum number of trousers is 10, then x = (810 - 300)/40 = 12.75, which is not an integer. If the maximum number of trousers is 9, then x = (810 - 270)/40 = 13.5, which is not an integer. If the maximum number of trousers is 8, then x = (810 - 240)/40 = 14.25, which is not an integer. If the maximum number of trousers is 7, then x = (810 - 210)/40 = 15, which is an integer.

According to the problem, Mohan will receive the same amount as Sohan when they both reach the age of 26 years. Since Mohan is 23 years old and Sohan is 24 years old, Mohan will reach 26 years in 3 years and Sohan will reach 26 years in 2 years. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n4% * x * 3 = 4% * (5100 - x) * 2\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n12x = 8(5100 - x)\n\n12x = 40800 - 8x\n\n20x = 40800\n\nx = 2040\n\nSo, Mohan's share is Rs. 2040.

To find the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain, we can set up the equation (w/25)/x * t = y, where t is the time in seconds. Solving for t, we get t = yx/(w/25), which simplifies to t = 25xy/w seconds. To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60, so the final answer is t = (25xy/w)/60 = 5xy/(12w) minutes.

The discriminant is given by the formula D = b^2 - 4ac, where a = 1, b = -5, and c = k in this case. So D = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k. We need 25 - 4k > 0, which means k < 25/4 = 6.25. The largest integral value of k that satisfies this condition is 6. However, this is not one of the answer choices, so we must have made an error in our calculations.\n\nLet's try again: D = b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k. We need 25 - 4k > 0, which means k < 25/4 = 6.25. The largest integral value of k that satisfies this condition is 6.

Find the gea fo Jeo's father?\nChoices: (A)45 (B)48 (C)50 (D)55 (E)58\nAnswer:", "output": "Let Joe's age be J, his sister's age be S, and his father's age be F. We are given that J + S + F = 100. \n\nWhen Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as now, so J + S = 2S. \n\nWhen Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father, so F + S = 2(F - S). \n\nNow we have a system of three equations with three variables: \n1) J + S + F = 100\n2) J + S = 2S\n3) F + S = 2(F - S)\n\nSolving for J in equation 2, we get J = S. Substituting this into equation 1, we get S + S + F = 100, which simplifies to 2S + F = 100. \n\nSolving for F in equation 3, we get F = 2F - 4S. Substituting this into the equation 2S + F = 100, we get 2S + (2F - 4S) = 100, which simplifies to 2S = 100 - 2F + 4S. Solving for S, we get S = 50 - F. \n\nSubstituting this back into the equation J = S, we get J = 50 - F. \n\nNow we have J = 50 - F and F = 2F - 4S. Substituting the first equation into the second, we get F = 2(50 - F) - 4S, which simplifies to F = 100 - 2F - 4S. Adding 2F to both sides, we get 3F = 100 - 4S. \n\nSince S = 50 - F, we can substitute this back into the equation 3F = 100 - 4S, which gives us 3F = 100 - 4(50 - F). Simplifying, we get 3F = 100 - 200 + 4F, which gives us F = 100. \n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices.

We want to find m in terms of y, so we can divide both sides of the equation by 4y to get x/(4y) = m/100. Multiplying both sides by 100, we get m = 100x/(4y) = 25x/y. Since we want m as a percentage of x, we can divide both sides by x to get m/x = 25/y. Multiplying both sides by 100, we get (m/x)*100 = 2500/y. So m is 2500/y percent of x.

Since the worker drives at 20 km/hr for 9 minutes, the distance is 20 km/hr * (9 min / 60 min/hr) = 3 km. Now, we need to find how long it takes to cycle at 6 km/hr. The time would be 3 km / 6 km/hr = 0.5 hr, which is equal to 0.5 hr * 60 min/hr = 30 minutes. The answer is (A).", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "A"}

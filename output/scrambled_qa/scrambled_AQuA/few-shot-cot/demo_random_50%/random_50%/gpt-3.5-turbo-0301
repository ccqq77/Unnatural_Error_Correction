Then we have the following diagram:\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C,D;\nA = (0,0);\nB = (4,0);\nC = (4,3);\nD = (0,3);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(4,3));\nlabel(\"$h$\",(2,1.5),NE);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(2,-0.5),S);\nlabel(\"$45^\\circ$\",(0.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"$60^\\circ$\",(3.5,0),S);\n[/asy]\n\nUsing trigonometry, we have $\\tan 45^\\circ = \\frac{h}{x}$ and $\\tan 60^\\circ = \\frac{h}{x+d}$, where $d$ is the distance the car travels before the angle of elevation changes. Simplifying these equations, we get $x=h$ and $x+d=\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Solving for $h$ and $d$, we get $h=x$ and $d=\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}-h=\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}-1}$.\n\nSince it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from $45^\\circ$ to $60^\\circ$, we know that $\\frac{d}{v}=10$, where $v$ is the speed of the car. Substituting in the expression for $d$, we get $\\frac{h}{v(\\sqrt{3}-1)}=10$. Solving for $h$, we get $h=10v(\\sqrt{3}-1)$.\n\nTo find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower, we need to find the distance it travels. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $x^2+h^2=(10v)^2$. Substituting in the expression for $h$, we get $x^2+(10v(\\sqrt{3}-1))^2=(10v)^2$. Simplifying, we get $x^2=100v^2-200v^2\\sqrt{3}+100v^2$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x=10v\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nFinally, we can solve for the time it takes using the equation $\\frac{x}{v}=\\frac{10v\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{3}}}{v}=10\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{3}}$.

Then the original retail price is $x + 60$. If it was sold for 20% less than the original price, then it was sold for $(1-0.2)(x+60) = 0.8x + 48$. \n\nThe profit made on the sale is the difference between the selling price and the wholesale cost, which is $(0.8x + 48) - x = -0.2x + 48$. Since the profit is negative, the item was sold for less than the wholesale cost. \n\nThe percent more than the wholesale cost that the original retail price was is $\\frac{x+60-x}{x} \\cdot 100\\% = 60\\%$. \n\nTo find the percent less than the original retail price that the item was sold for, we can use the formula $\\frac{\\text{new value}}{\\text{original value}} \\cdot 100\\%$. Plugging in the values we found, we get $\\frac{0.8x+48}{x+60} \\cdot 100\\%$. \n\nSimplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{x+60-12}{x+60} \\cdot 100\\% = \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{x+48}{x+60} \\cdot 100\\%$. \n\nSince we know the item was sold for less than the wholesale cost, we know that $\\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{x+48}{x+60} < 1$. \n\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac{5(x+60)}{4(x+48)}$, we get $\\frac{5(x+60)}{4(x+48)} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{x+48}{x+60} < \\frac{5(x+60)}{4(x+48)} \\cdot 1$. \n\nSimplifying the left side, we get $\\frac{x+60}{x+48} < \\frac{5(x+60)}{4(x+48)}$. \n\nMultiplying both sides by $(x+48)$, we get $x+60 < \\frac{5(x+60)(x+48)}{4(x+48)}$. \n\nSimplifying this expression, we get $x+60 < \\frac{5}{4}(x+60)$. \n\nSubtracting $x+60$ from both sides, we get $0 < \\frac{1}{4}(x+60)$. \n\nSince $x$ is a positive number (it represents the wholesale cost), we know that $x+60$ is also positive. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{4}(x+60)$ is positive, which means that $0 < \\frac{1}{4}(x+60)$ is true. \n\nThis tells us that $\\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{x+48}{x+60} < 1$, which means that the percent less than the original retail price that the item was sold for is less than 100%. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }20\\%}$.", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "B"}

Let's assume the length of the rectangle is L and the width is W. Then the distance traveled by the ant along the four sides of the rectangle would be 2L + 2W. \n\nThe time taken for each side would be: \n- L/200 for the first side \n- W/400 for the second side \n- L/600 for the third side \n- W/800 for the fourth side \n\nSo the total time taken would be: \nL/200 + W/400 + L/600 + W/800 \n\nTo simplify this expression, we can find the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 2400. Then we can rewrite each fraction with the common denominator: \n12L/2400 + 6W/2400 + 4L/2400 + 3W/2400 \n\nCombining like terms, we get: \n(16L + 9W)/2400 \n\nNow we can divide the total distance (2L + 2W) by the total time [(16L + 9W)/2400] to get the average speed: \n(2L + 2W) / [(16L + 9W)/2400] \n\nSimplifying this expression, we get: \n(4800L + 4800W) / (16L + 9W) \n\nDividing both numerator and denominator by 16, we get: \n(300L + 300W) / (L + 9W/16) \n\nSince we don't know the exact dimensions of the rectangle, we can't find the exact value of the average speed. However, we can see that the answer choices are all integers, so we can try plugging in some values for L and W to see which answer choice is closest to the result. For example, if we assume L = 16 and W = 9, then the average speed would be: \n(300(16) + 300(9)) / (16 + 9/16) = 562.5 \n\nThe closest answer choice is (B)562.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "A"}

We know that 24% of S are in both C and M, and that 20% of M are not in C. Let x be the percentage of S that are in M. Then we can write:\n\n- 24% of S are in both C and M, so 0.24S = |C \u2229 M|.\n- 20% of M are not in C, so 0.2M = |M \\ C|.\n- We also know that |C \u2229 M| + |C \\ M| + |M \\ C| = S.\n\nSubstituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get:\n\n- 0.24S + |C \\ M| + 0.2M = S.\n- |C \\ M| = S - 0.24S - 0.2M = 0.56S - 0.2M.\n\nWe want to find x, which is the percentage of S that are in M. We can write:\n\n- xS = M.\n\nWe can substitute this into the equation we just derived for |C \\ M|:\n\n- |C \\ M| = 0.56S - 0.2(xS) = 0.16S.\n\nWe know that |C \\ M| is also equal to the percentage of S that are in C but not in M. Let y be this percentage. Then we can write:\n\n- yS = |C \\ M| = 0.16S.\n- y = 0.16.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of S that are in M is x = 1 - y = 0.84, or 84%.

Since we want to find the amount of health food needed to provide both vitamins, we need to use the smaller value of x, which is x = minimum daily requirement / 9.\n\nSubstituting this value of x into either equation gives us the amount of health food needed to provide the minimum daily requirement of that vitamin. For example, if the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 81 units, then we need 9x = 81 grams of health food to provide that amount of vitamin E.\n\nSince we need to provide both vitamins, we take the larger of the two amounts of health food needed. For example, if we need 81 grams of health food to provide the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 64 grams of health food to provide the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, then we need at least 81 grams of health food to provide both vitamins.\n\nThe answer choices are all half-integers, so we need to divide our answer by 2 to see if it matches any of the choices.

So the length of the fence in feet is 6.5 times the number of pairs of pickets, which is (500-1)/(0.5+6) = 72. Therefore, the length of the fence in inches is 72*12 = 864. The length of the pickets is x inches each, so the total length of all the pickets is 500x. Therefore, the length of the spaces between the pickets is 864 - 500x. Each space is 1.5 inches wide, so the total width of all the spaces is 1.5 times the number of pairs of pickets, which is (500-1)/2 = 249.5. Therefore, we have the equation 1.5*249.5 = 864 - 500x, which simplifies to 373.25 = 864 - 500x. Solving for x, we get x = (13/2) - (373.25/500) = (13/2) - 0.7465 = 11.2535/2.

Then we have:\n\nDistance traveled by ship = x * t * 180 km\nDistance traveled by plane = 10x * t * 180 km = 1800x * t km\n\nSince they meet at the same point, these distances must be equal.

Also, M - N = 99(b - c) + 9(a - b), so M - N is divisible by 9. Therefore, 396c = 4(M - N) is also divisible by 9. This means that c is divisible by 9, and since c is a digit, c must be equal to 9. \n\nSubstituting c = 9 into the equation M - N + 396c = 990, we get M - N = 54. Since M > N, we know that b > c = 9, so b must be either 1 or 2. If b = 1, then a must be at least 6, which means that M is at least 619. But in this case, N is at most 916, so M - N is at least 619 - 916 = -297, which is not equal to 54. Therefore, we must have b = 2. \n\nIf b = 2, then a must be at least 7, which means that M is at least 729. In this case, N is at most 927, so M - N is at least 729 - 927 = -198, which is not equal to 54.

In those 3 hours, Train A travels 40 km/hr * 3 hrs = 120 km. Let's call the distance between Mumbai and the point where the two trains meet \"x\". Then, Train A travels x - 120 km and Train B travels x km. The combined speed of the two trains is 40 km/hr + 72 km/hr = 112 km/hr. Using the formula distance = rate * time, we can set up the equation (x - 120) + x = 112t, where t is the time in hours that the trains travel before they meet. Simplifying, we get 2x - 120 = 112t, or x = 56t + 60. We want to find the time at which the two trains meet, so we need to solve for t. We know that Train B leaves at 2 pm, which is 3 hours after Train A leaves, so t = 3 + (time until they meet). Plugging this into our equation for x, we get x = 56(3 + time until they meet) + 60. We also know that the total distance between Mumbai and Lucknow is 1440 km (based on the given information that Train B travels at 72 km/hr for 20 hours). So we can set up the equation x + 120 = 1440, or x = 1320. Plugging this into our equation for x, we get 1320 = 56(3 + time until they meet) + 60, which simplifies to 1200 = 56(time until they meet). Solving for time until they meet, we get time until they meet = 1200/56 = 21.43 hours. Adding this to the 3 hours that Train A has already traveled, we get a total time of 24.43 hours, or 12:26 pm on the next day. The answer is (A).", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "A"}

However, any set of 4 points will form a quadrilateral, so we need to subtract the number of sets of 4 points that form a triangle. There are 6 ways to choose 3 points to form a triangle, and for each triangle, there are 2 ways to add a fourth point to form a quadrilateral. So there are $6 \\cdot 2 = 12$ sets of 4 points that form a triangle. Therefore, there are $15 - 12 = 3$ sets of 4 points that form a quadrilateral but not a triangle.

Then we can set up the following equations:\n\n- A's profit + B's profit + C's profit = total profit\n- A's profit = (12 - x - y)/12 * 375,000\n- B's profit = (10 - x)/12 * 375,000\n- C's profit = (12 - y)/12 * 375,000 + 150,000\n\nSubstituting in the given values, we get:\n\n- (12 - x - y)/12 * 375,000 + (10 - x)/12 * 375,000 + (12 - y)/12 * 375,000 + 150,000 = 375,000\n- (12 - x - y)/12 * 375,000 = (2 + x)/12 * 375,000\n- (12 - x - y) = 2 + x\n- y = 10 - 2x\n\nWe know that B joined with Rs.60,000 after 2 months, so his profit for the year would be (10/12) * 375,000 = Rs.312,500. We also know that C's profit was Rs.150,000. So we can set up another equation:\n\n- A's profit + B's profit + C's profit = total profit\n- A's profit = 375,000 - 312,500 - 150,000 = -87,500\n\nSince A's profit cannot be negative, we know that our assumption that C joined after B is incorrect. So we try the other possibility:\n\n- B joined after C\n- A's profit + C's profit + B's profit = total profit\n- A's profit = (12 - x - y)/12 * 375,000\n- C's profit = (12 - x)/12 * 375,000 + 150,000\n- B's profit = (10 - y)/12 * 375,000\n\nSubstituting in the given values, we get:\n\n- (12 - x - y)/12 * 375,000 + (12 - x)/12 * 375,000 + (10 - y)/12 * 375,000 = 375,000\n- (12 - x - y) + (12 - x) + (10 - y) = 36\n- -2x - 2y = -14\n- x + y = 7\n\nWe know that C joined with Rs.120,000 after some time, so his profit for the year would be (y/12) * 375,000 = Rs.31,250y. We also know that B's profit was Rs.60,000 for 10 - y months. So we can set up another equation:\n\n- A's profit + C's profit + B's profit = total profit\n- A's profit = 375,000 - 31,250y - 60,000 = 315,000 - 31,250y\n\nWe know that A's profit cannot be negative, so we try different values of y until we get a positive value for A's profit:\n\n- y = 1: A's profit = 283,750 (positive)\n- y = 2: A's profit = 252,500 (positive)\n- y = 3: A's profit = 221,250 (positive)\n- y = 4: A's profit = 190,000 (positive)\n- y = 5: A's profit = 158,750 (positive)\n- y = 6: A's profit = 127,500 (positive)\n- y = 7: A's profit = 96,250 (positive)\n\nSo C joined after 4 months and the answer is (B).", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "B"}

Find the ubnrme.\nChoices: (A)368 (B)377 (C)288 (D)997 (E)112\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the three digit number be $abc$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits. We know that $a+b+c=17$ and $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$. We can use the first equation to solve for $c$ in terms of $a$ and $b$: $c=17-a-b$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $a^2+b^2+(17-a-b)^2=109$. Simplifying this equation gives $2a^2+2b^2+2ab-34a-34b+210=0$. We can factor this equation as $(a+b-17)(2a+2b-12)=0$. Since $a+b=17$, we have $2a+2b=34$, so $2a+2b-12=22$. Therefore, $a+b=17$ and $2a+2b=12$ are the two possible cases. \n\nCase 1: $a+b=17$\nIn this case, we have $c=0$. The original number is $abc=100a+10b+c=100a+10b$. The reversed number is $cba=10c+b=10b$. We know that $100a+10b-495=10b+100a$, so $495=0$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.\n\nCase 2: $2a+2b=12$\nIn this case, we have $a+b=6$ and $c=11$. The original number is $abc=100a+10b+c=100a+10b+11$. The reversed number is $cba=10c+b=110+b$. We know that $100a+10b+11-495=110+b$, so $100a+10b-384=b$. Substituting $a+b=6$ into this equation gives $100a+60-384=b$, so $100a-324=b$. Since $a+b=6$, we have $a=6-b$. Substituting this into the equation $a+b+c=17$ gives $c=11+b$. Therefore, the original number is $abc=600-100b+10b+11=611-90b$, and the reversed number is $cba=110+b$. \n\nSince $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$, we have $a^2+b^2+(17-a-b)^2=109$, which simplifies to $2a^2+2b^2+2ab-34a-34b+210=0$. Substituting $a=6-b$ into this equation gives $2(6-b)^2+2b^2+2(6-b)b-34(6-b)-34b+210=0$, which simplifies to $-4b^2+68b-200=0$. Dividing both sides by $4$ gives $-b^2+17b-50=0$, which factors as $(b-2)(b-15)=0$. Therefore, $b=2$ or $b=15$. \n\nIf $b=2$, then the original number is $611-90b=431$, and the reversed number is $110+b=112$. Checking, we see that $431-495=-64$, which is not the reversed number $112$. Therefore, $b$ cannot be $2$. \n\nIf $b=15$, then the original number is $611-90b=-239$, and the reversed number is $110+b=125$. Checking, we see that $-239-495=-734$, which is the reversed number $125$ in reverse order. Therefore, the three digit number is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }997}$.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "A"}

So for every 2 grams of zinc, there is 1 gram of copper. Therefore, in 40 grams of alloy X, there are 2/3 * 40 = 80/3 grams of zinc and 1/3 * 40 = 40/3 grams of copper. \n\nFor alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:4. So for every 7 grams of zinc, there are 4 grams of copper. Therefore, in 60 grams of alloy Y, there are 7/11 * 60 = 420/11 grams of zinc and 4/11 * 60 = 240/11 grams of copper. \n\nAdding these amounts together, we get a total of 80/3 + 420/11 grams of zinc and 40/3 + 240/11 grams of copper in the mixture. \n\nTo simplify the ratio, we can multiply both sides by 33 to get rid of the fractions: \n\n(80/3 + 420/11) / (40/3 + 240/11) = (880/33) / (400/33) = 22/10 = 11/5 \n\nSo the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 11:5.

We know that x^2 - y^2 = 256000 and xy = 1000. Factoring x^2 - y^2, we get (x+y)(x-y) = 256000. We also know that xy = 1000, so y = 1000/x. Substituting this into the first equation, we get x^2 - (1000/x)^2 = 256000. Simplifying, we get x^4 - 256000x^2 - 1000000 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in x^2, so we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x^2: x^2 = (256000 \u00b1 sqrt(256000^2 + 4(1)(1000000))) / 2 = 640 or -400. Since we are looking for positive values of x and y, we can discard the negative solution. So x^2 = 640, which means x = 8sqrt(10). Substituting this into xy = 1000, we get y = 125/sqrt(10).

Then we have xy = 6 lakh and (x+6)(y+60) = 6.24 lakh. Expanding the second equation and substituting xy = 6 lakh, we get 6xy + 360x + 60y + 3600 = 6.24xy + 374.4x + 62.4y + 3744. Solving for xy, we get xy = 6 lakh and substituting back, we get 360x + 60y = 24000. Dividing by 60, we get 6x + y = 400. Substituting xy = 6 lakh, we get y = 10000/x. Substituting into 6x + y = 400, we get 6x + 10000/x = 400. Multiplying by x, we get 6x^2 + 10000 = 400x. Rearranging, we get 6x^2 - 400x + 10000 = 0. Factoring out 2, we get 2(3x^2 - 200x + 5000) = 0. Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get x = 100 or x = 50/3. Since x cannot be a fraction, the answer is x = 100.

We know that 80% of the eligible voters cast their votes, so the total number of votes cast is 0.8(4,000) = 3,200. Therefore, 2.15x = 3,200, which means x = 1,488.

What is the nimummi number of perpco coins that hes brought?\nChoices: (A)4 (B)3 (C)2 (D)1 (E)0\nAnswer:", "output": "Let's call the number of nickel coins x and the number of brass coins y. We can set up two equations based on the information given:\n\n0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40 (since the diver got $3.40 total)\nx + y = minimum number of coins (since we want to find the minimum number of coins)\n\nWe can solve for y in the second equation to get y = minimum number of coins - x. Then we can substitute this into the first equation:\n\n0.20x + 0.25(minimum number of coins - x) = 3.40\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n0.05x + 0.25(minimum number of coins) = 3.40\n\nWe know that x and the minimum number of coins must be integers, so we can try different values of x until we find one that gives us an integer solution for the minimum number of coins. If we try x = 10, we get:\n\n0.05(10) + 0.25(minimum number of coins) = 3.40\n0.50 + 0.25(minimum number of coins) = 3.40\n0.25(minimum number of coins) = 2.90\nminimum number of coins = 11.6\n\nThis isn't an integer solution, so we need to try a smaller value of x. If we try x = 8, we get:\n\n0.05(8) + 0.25(minimum number of coins) = 3.40\n0.40 + 0.25(minimum number of coins) = 3.40\n0.25(minimum number of coins) = 3.00\nminimum number of coins = 12\n\nThis is an integer solution, so the minimum number of coins is 12. To check that this is the minimum, we can try larger values of x and see if they give us a smaller minimum number of coins. For example, if we try x = 9, we get:\n\n0.05(9) + 0.25(minimum number of coins) = 3.40\n0.45 + 0.25(minimum number of coins) = 3.40\n0.25(minimum number of coins) = 2.95\nminimum number of coins = 11.8\n\nThis is not an integer solution, so the minimum number of coins is indeed 12.

Then, the probability that at least one of events A or B occurs is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). We know that this probability is 0.96, and we know that P(A) = 0.6. We don't know P(A and B), but we can solve for it:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - P(A and B)\n0.36 = P(B) - P(A and B)\n\nWe also know that events A and B are independent, so P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). Substituting this into the equation above, we get:\n\n0.36 = P(B) - 0.6P(B)\n0.96 = 0.4P(B)\nP(B) = 0.96 / 0.4 = 0.24 / 0.1 = 2.4\n\nHowever, probabilities must be between 0 and 1, so this answer doesn't make sense.

We know that y trousers cost a total of 70y rupees, and x shirts cost a total of 30x rupees. We also know that the total cost of the purchase was 810 rupees, so:\n\n70y + 30x = 810\n\nWe want to maximize the ratio of shirts to trousers, which means we want to maximize x/y. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other:\n\n70y + 30x = 810\n30x = 810 - 70y\nx = (810 - 70y)/30\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x into our ratio:\n\nx/y = ((810 - 70y)/30)/y\nx/y = (810 - 70y)/(30y)\n\nTo maximize this ratio, we want to find the value of y that makes the denominator as small as possible. The denominator is a quadratic expression, so we can find its minimum value by finding the vertex of the parabola:\n\ny = -b/2a = -(-70)/(2*15) = 7\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 7. We can substitute this value of y back into our equation for x:\n\nx = (810 - 70(7))/30 = 8\n\nSo the maximum number of shirts that can be purchased is 8.

Since there were 20 flips in total and neither person gained or lost any money, we know that the number of times the coin landed on tails must also be 20-x. \n\nNow let's look at the money exchanged. Each time the coin landed on heads, Christopher gave $2 to Jonathan. So the total amount of money Christopher gave to Jonathan is 2x. Each time the coin landed on tails, Jonathan gave $3 to Christopher. So the total amount of money Jonathan gave to Christopher is 3(20-x) = 60-3x. \n\nSince neither person gained or lost any money, we know that the total amount of money exchanged must be 0. So we can set up an equation: \n\n2x = 60-3x \n\nSolving for x, we get x = 12. \n\nSo the coin landed on heads 12 times. The answer is (E).", "pred_strict": "E", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "E"}

For example, we can solve for L:\n\nL = 170 - W\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the cost, we get:\n\n10(170 - W)W\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n1700W - 10W^2\n\nThis is a quadratic function of W, which has a maximum value at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by:\n\nx = -b/2a\n\nIn this case, a = -10 and b = 1700, so:\n\nx = -1700/(2(-10)) = 85\n\nSo the maximum cost occurs when W = 85.

So we can set up the equation: \n\n2x/(2x + 3x + 5x) = 3/100 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n2x/10x = 3/100 \n\nCross-multiplying, we get: \n\n200x = 30x \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx = 1/6 \n\nSo the amount of rice in the mixture is: \n\n2x = 2/6 = 1/3 \n\nAnd if a bag of the mixture contains 3 drops of rice, then each drop contains 1/9 of the total amount of rice. So the total amount of rice in the bag is: \n\n3 drops * (1/9) = 1/3 \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 6.", "pred_strict": "D", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "B"}

The company promises to deliver 7200 pens, so the total number of pens manufactured must be 7200 / 0.9 = 8000. If the desired proportion of good pens is 25%, then the number of good pens must be 8000 * 0.25 = 2000. This means that the number of defective pens is 8000 - 2000 = 6000. \n\nLet the cost of each good pen be x. Then the total cost of manufacturing all the pens is 8000x. The cost of the defective pens is 6000 * x/10 = 600x.

We want to find the number of files not infected by a worm, which is V + B.\n\nIf 50% of the files are not infected by a virus, then the number of files infected by a virus is 0.5(250) = 125.

Let the weight of the minimum in the alloy be x grams and the weight of the silver be y grams. Then we know that x + y = 30 (since the total weight of the coin is 30 grams) and y = 2x (since the volume of minimum is equal to that of silver). Solving for x and y, we get x = 10 grams and y = 20 grams. \n\nNow, for the pure aluminum coin with the same dimensions, its volume would also be 60 mm^3. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of the aluminum in the alloy coin is equivalent to the weight of the silver in the pure aluminum coin. So the weight of the aluminum in the pure aluminum coin is also 20 grams. \n\nUsing the density of aluminum (2.7 g/cm^3), we can find the mass of the pure aluminum coin: \n\nmass = density x volume = 2.7 g/cm^3 x 0.6 cm^3 = 1.62 grams \n\nTo find the weight of the pure aluminum coin, we need to convert grams to rgsma: \n\nweight = 1.62 grams x (1 rgsma / 0.001 grams) = 1620 rgsma \n\nSo the weight of the pure aluminum coin with dimensions 1 x 30 mm is 1620 rgsma, which is equivalent to 36 grams.

Then the unpainted side has area LW, and the sum of the perimeters of the other three sides is 2LH + 2WH = 37. We also know that LW = 9. \n\nWe can use the fact that the volume of the rectangular prism is LWH to eliminate one variable. Solving for H, we get H = 9/LW. Substituting this into the equation for the sum of the perimeters, we get:\n\n2L(9/LW) + 2W(9/LW) = 37\n18/L + 18/W = 37\n18W + 18L = 37LW\n18L - 37LW + 18W = 0\n(2L - 37W)(9W) = 0\n\nSince L and W are both positive, we must have 2L = 37W. Substituting this into LW = 9, we get:\n\n(37W)(W) = 9\nW^2 = 9/37\nW = 3/sqrt(37)\n\nThen L = 74/sqrt(37). The area of the parking space is LW = (74/sqrt(37))(3/sqrt(37)) = 222/37 = 6.

This means that there are 4x hours of work left to be done. \n\nLet's say it takes Lili y hours to finish the remaining work. Since her rate of alignment is 5% of Jack's rate, she can finish 1/240 of the job in one hour (since 1/12 * 1/20 = 1/240). \n\nUsing the formula \"rate x time = work,\" we can set up the equation: \n\n(1/240)y = 4x \n\nSolving for y, we get: \n\ny = 960x \n\nSo it will take Lili 960x hours to finish the remaining work. Since x represents the number of hours it takes Jack to finish the entire job, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation to get: \n\ny = 960 \n\nSo it will take Lili 960 hours to finish the remaining work. However, we need to convert this to a time in hours and minutes. \n\n960 hours is equal to 40 days (since there are 24 hours in a day). So the answer is (D) 50, since 40 days is equal to 40 + 10 = 50 days.", "pred_strict": "D", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "E"}

To minimize the amount of fencing needed, we want to minimize this expression. Taking the derivative with respect to L and setting it equal to 0, we get 2 - 240/L^2 = 0, which gives us L = 20.

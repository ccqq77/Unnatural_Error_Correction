Then x + y = 18 + (10x + y). This simplifies to 11x + 2y = 18. Since the digit in the unit's place is odd, x must be odd. So x = 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. If x = 1, then 11x + 2y = 18 implies that y = 8. So the number is 18. If x = 3, then 11x + 2y = 18 implies that y = 6. So the number is 36. If x = 5, then 11x + 2y = 18 implies that y = 4. So the number is 54. If x = 7, then 11x + 2y = 18 implies that y = 2. So the number is 72. If x = 9, then 11x + 2y = 18 implies that y = 0. So the number is 90.

Let Joe's age = x, Joe's sister's age = y, and Joe's father's age = z. So x + y + z = 100. When Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. So z = 2y. Substituting this into the equation, we get x + y + 2y = 100. This simplifies to 3y + x = 100. So y = (100 - x) / 3. Substituting this into the equation for z, we get z = 2(100 - x) / 3. So z = 200 - 2x / 3. Since x + y + z = 100, we can substitute the values of y and z into the equation to get x + (100 - x) / 3 + (200 - 2x) / 3 = 100. This simplifies to 3x + 100 = 300. So x = 200 / 3 = 66.66. Joe's father's age is 200 - 2x / 3 = 200 - 132.66 / 3 = 67.33. The answer is (A).", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "C"}

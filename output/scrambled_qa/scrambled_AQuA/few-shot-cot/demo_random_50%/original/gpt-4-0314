The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0.

Then, we have the following equations from the angle of elevation:\n\n$\\tan(45^\\circ) = \\frac{h}{x} \\Rightarrow h = x$\n\n$\\tan(60^\\circ) = \\frac{h}{x - vt} \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{3} = \\frac{x}{x - vt}$, where $v$ is the speed of the car and $t$ is the time it takes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0.\n\nSince it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change, we have $t = 10$. Now, we can substitute $h = x$ into the second equation:\n\n$\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{x}{x - 10v} \\Rightarrow x\\sqrt{3} = x^2 - 10vx$\n\nNow, let's find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower. Let this time be $T$. Then, we have:\n\n$x = v(T + 10)$\n\nWe want to find the value of $T$. We can substitute this expression for $x$ into the equation we derived earlier:\n\n$(v(T + 10))\\sqrt{3} = (v(T + 10))^2 - 10v^2(T + 10)$\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $v(T + 10)$:\n\n$\\sqrt{3} = v(T + 10) - 10v$\n\nNow, we can solve for $T$:\n\n$T = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 10v - v}{v} = 10 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - v}{v}$\n\nSince we don't know the value of $v$, we cannot find an exact value for $T$.

So, 2L + 2(W/2) = 66, which simplifies to 2L + W = 66.\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\nL + 2W = 48\n2L + W = 66\n\nWe can solve this system by multiplying the first equation by 2 and then subtracting the second equation from the result:\n\n2(L + 2W) = 2(48)\n2L + 4W = 96\n(2L + 4W) - (2L + W) = 96 - 66\n3W = 30\nW = 10\n\nNow we can substitute this value of W back into one of the original equations to find L:\n\nL + 2(10) = 48\nL + 20 = 48\nL = 28\n\nNow that we have the dimensions of the rectangle, we can find the area:\n\nArea = L * W = 28 * 10 = 280\n\nThe area of the sheet is 280 square centimeters.

Find the average speed of the plane around the field?\nChoices: (A)384 (B)562 (C)458 (D)156 (E)452\nAnswer:", "output": "The average speed of the plane around the field can be found by using the formula for average speed: total distance / total time. Since the plane is flying around a square, the total distance is 4 times the side length of the square. Let the side length be s.\n\nThe time taken for each side can be calculated as distance / speed. So the total time taken is:\nt1 = s / 200\nt2 = s / 400\nt3 = s / 600\nt4 = s / 800\n\nTotal time = t1 + t2 + t3 + t4 = (s / 200) + (s / 400) + (s / 600) + (s / 800)\n\nNow we can find the average speed:\nAverage speed = (4s) / ((s / 200) + (s / 400) + (s / 600) + (s / 800))\n\nTo simplify, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 2400:\nAverage speed = (4s * 2400) / (12s + 6s + 4s + 3s)\n\nAverage speed = (9600s) / (25s)\n\nAverage speed = 384 km/hr\n\nThe answer is (A) 384.", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "A"}

How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?\nChoices: (A)10,8 (B)9,8 (C)7,8 (D)5,6 (E)11,12\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the number of white sharpeners be x and the number of brown sharpeners be y. Then x + y = 18. Let the cost of each brown sharpener be b rupees. Then the cost of each white sharpener is (b+1) rupees. So xb + y(b+1) = 100. Substituting x = 18 - y, we get (18-y)b + y(b+1) = 100. Simplifying, we get 18b - yb + yb + y = 100, which means 18b + y = 100. Since y is an integer, b must be a multiple of 2. Trying b = 2, we get y = 64, which is too large. Trying b = 4, we get y = 28, which is still too large. Trying b = 6, we get y = 8, which is a valid solution. So there are 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.

However, this answer is not in the choices, so let's try another approach.\n\nLet x be the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with 64 water lilies initially. In x days, the number of water lilies would double 30 times (since it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with 1 water lily). So, we have:\n\n64 * 2^(x/2) = 2^30\n\nDivide both sides by 64:\n\n2^(x/2) = 2^26\n\nSince the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal:\n\nx/2 = 26\n\nx = 52\n\nSo it would take 52 days for the lake to be fully covered with 64 water lilies initially.

The height of the room is:\nChoices: (A)2.6m (B)3.9m (C)4m (D)4.2m (E)4.4m\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the height of the room be 2x meters and the semi-perimeter be 5x meters. The total area of the walls, including doors and windows, is 2x * 5x = 10x^2 square meters. Since 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows, the area to be papered is 10x^2 - 15 sq.m.\n\nThe cost of papering the walls is Rs.260, and the paper is 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter. So, the total length of the paper used is 260 / 2 = 130 meters. Since the paper is 50cm wide, the area covered by the paper is 130 * 0.5 = 65 sq.m.\n\nNow, we have the equation 10x^2 - 15 = 65.

Then, 70x + 30y = 810. To maximize the number of trousers, we need to minimize the number of shirts. So, we can start by trying to find the smallest possible value of y that satisfies the equation. If y = 1, then 70x + 30 = 810, which means x = 780 / 70 = 11.4, which is not an integer. If y = 2, then 70x + 60 = 810, which means x = 750 / 70 = 10.71, which is also not an integer. If y = 3, then 70x + 90 = 810, which means x = 720 / 70 = 10.29, which is still not an integer. If y = 4, then 70x + 120 = 810, which means x = 690 / 70 = 9.86, which is not an integer. If y = 5, then 70x + 150 = 810, which means x = 660 / 70 = 9.43, which is not an integer. If y = 6, then 70x + 180 = 810, which means x = 630 / 70 = 9, which is an integer.

So, (A + D) / (B + D + 48) = 27 / 39. \n\nSubstituting the values of A and B, we get (27x + D) / (39x + D + 48) = 27 / 39. \n\nCross-multiplying and simplifying, we get 27(39x + D + 48) = 39(27x + D). \n\nExpanding and simplifying further, we get 1053x + 27D + 1296 = 1035x + 39D. \n\nRearranging the terms, we get 12D = 18x - 1296. \n\nSince D = A + B = 27x + 39x = 66x, we can substitute this value in the equation: \n\n12(66x) = 18x - 1296. \n\nSimplifying, we get 792x = 18x - 1296. \n\nSubtracting 18x from both sides, we get 774x = -1296. \n\nDividing both sides by 774, we get x = -1296 / 774 = -2. \n\nSince x cannot be negative, there is no solution for the given problem.

Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which\nChoices: (A)L(x,y) = R(x,y) (B)L(x,y) \u2260 R(x,y) (C)L(x,y) < R(x,y) (D)L(x,y) < R(x,y) (E)None\nAnswer:", "output": "Let's first analyze the two functions L(x,y) and R(x,y). \n\nFor L(x,y), we have [x] + [y] + [x + y]. Since [x] and [y] are the greatest integers less than or equal to x and y, respectively, [x + y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x + y. \n\nFor R(x,y), we have [2x] + [2y]. Since [2x] and [2y] are the greatest integers less than or equal to 2x and 2y, respectively, [2x] + [2y] is the sum of the greatest integers less than or equal to 2x and 2y.\n\nNow let's consider the possible values of x and y. Since x and y are positive real numbers, we can have the following cases:\n\n1. x and y are both integers: In this case, [x] = x, [y] = y, [x + y] = x + y, [2x] = 2x, and [2y] = 2y. So L(x,y) = x + y + (x + y) = 2x + 2y, and R(x,y) = 2x + 2y. Thus, L(x,y) = R(x,y).\n\n2. x and y are both non-integers: In this case, [x] < x, [y] < y, [x + y] \u2264 x + y, [2x] < 2x, and [2y] < 2y. So L(x,y) < x + y + (x + y) = 2x + 2y, and R(x,y) \u2264 2x + 2y. Thus, L(x,y) < R(x,y).\n\n3. One of x and y is an integer, and the other is a non-integer: Without loss of generality, let x be an integer and y be a non-integer. In this case, [x] = x, [y] < y, [x + y] \u2264 x + y, [2x] = 2x, and [2y] < 2y. So L(x,y) < x + y + (x + y) = 2x + 2y, and R(x,y) \u2264 2x + 2y. Thus, L(x,y) < R(x,y).\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) \u2260 R(x,y).

Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, the volume of aluminum in the coin is half the total volume, or 112.5\u03c0 mm^3. The weight of the aluminum in the coin is then 30 grams / 3 = 10 grams, since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum.\n\nNow, we want to find the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum. The volume of this coin is given by V = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(15^2)(1) = 225\u03c0 mm^3. Since this coin is made of pure aluminum, its volume is equal to the volume of aluminum in the original coin.

We should have written 25 - 4k > 0, not 25 - 4k < 0. So, we should have divided by -4 instead of 4. This gives us -6.25 + k > 0, so k > -6.25. The largest integral value of k that satisfies this inequality is k = 5. However, this is not one of the choices either. \n\nLet's try a different approach.

We are given that J + S + F = 100. \n\nWhen Joe is as old as his father, he will be F years old, and his sister will be twice as old as now, so she will be 2S years old. Since Joe's age will increase by (F - J) years, his sister's age will also increase by (F - J) years. So, S + (F - J) = 2S, which simplifies to F = J + S.\n\nWhen Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. At that time, Joe's father will be F + (F - J) years old, and his sister will be F years old. So, 2F = F + (F - J) + F, which simplifies to J = F.\n\nNow we have three equations:\n\n1.

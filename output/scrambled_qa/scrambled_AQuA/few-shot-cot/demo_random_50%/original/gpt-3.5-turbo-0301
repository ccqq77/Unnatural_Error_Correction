How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000?\nChoices: (A)15 (B)24 (C)25 (D)40 (E)52\nAnswer:", "output": "If the sales person makes $250 in each sale, then he would need to make 4 sales to reach a salary of $1000. However, he also gets a 10% commission on each sale, so he would need to make additional sales to reach a salary of at least $1000. \n\nLet's say he makes x additional sales. Then his total commission would be 0.1(4*$250 + x*$250) = $100 + $25x. \n\nWe want to find the value of x that makes his total commission at least $1000. So we set up the inequality: \n\n$100 + $25x \u2265 $1000 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n$25x \u2265 $900 \n\nx \u2265 36 \n\nSo he would need to make at least 36 additional sales, on top of the 4 sales he already made, to reach a salary of at least $1000. \n\nTherefore, the total number of sales he needs to make is 4 + 36 = 40.

To make a profit of $626,400 - $554,400 = $72,000, the total revenue from selling the components must be at least $626,400. \n\nThe revenue from selling one component is the selling price per component multiplied by the number of components sold. Let x be the selling price per component. Then the revenue from selling 420 components in one month is 420x, and the yearly revenue is 12(420x) = 5040x. \n\nTo make a profit of at least $72,000, we need 5040x - $554,400 \u2265 $72,000, which simplifies to 5040x \u2265 $626,400. Dividing both sides by 5040 gives x \u2265 $124, so the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $124. \n\nNone of the answer choices match exactly, but the closest one is (C)240.

If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?\nChoices: (A)(zy \u2013 2x)/z (B)(zy \u2013 2)/z (C)(zx \u2013 y)/(z \u2013 2) (D)(zy \u2013 2x)/(z -2) (E)(zy \u2013 x)/(z + 2)\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the highest score be H and the lowest score be L. We know that (H + L)/2 = x, so H + L = 2x. We also know that the average score for the entire class is y, so the sum of all the scores is yz. \n\nTo find the sum of all the scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we can subtract H and L from the sum of all the scores. So the sum of the remaining scores is yz - H - L. \n\nWe can express H and L in terms of x using the equation H + L = 2x. We know that there are z students in the class, so the sum of all the scores is the sum of the remaining scores plus H plus L: \n\nyz = yz - H - L + H + L \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\nyz = yz + 2x \n\n2x = 0 \n\nThis is a contradiction, so our initial assumption that the highest and lowest scorers are excluded must be incorrect.

During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?\nChoices: (A)15 (B)16 (C)17 (D)18 (E)19\nAnswer:", "output": "Let x be the number of toys made by Alex and y be the number of toys made by Jacob. We know that x + y = 35 and 7x + 9y = total number of hours worked by both of them. Since both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that their total number of hours worked is approximately the same. So we can set 7x + 9y = k(35), where k is some constant. Simplifying, we get 7x + 9y = 35k. We know that x + y = 35, so we can solve for y in terms of x: y = 35 - x. Substituting into the equation 7x + 9y = 35k, we get 7x + 9(35 - x) = 35k. Simplifying, we get 2x = 35k - 315, which means x = (35k - 315) / 2. Since x is the number of toys made by Alex, it must be an integer. This means that 35k - 315 must be even. The only value of k that works is k = 9, which gives x = 12 and y = 23. So Jacob made 23 toys. The answer is (E).", "pred_strict": "E", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "A"}

He replaces 15% of it with milk twice, which means he removes 15 mL of the tea and replaces it with 15 mL of milk, twice. After the first replacement, he has 85 mL of 50% strong milk tea. After the second replacement, he has 72.25 mL of 50% strong milk tea.\n\nThen, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk. 10% of 72.25 mL is 7.225 mL. So, he removes 7.225 mL of the solution and replaces it with 7.225 mL of milk. Now, he has a total of 72.25 mL + 7.225 mL = 79.475 mL of the final solution.\n\nTo find the final concentration of tea, we need to find the percentage of tea in the final solution. The amount of tea in the final solution is 72.25 mL, and the total volume of the final solution is 79.475 mL. So, the final concentration of tea is (72.25/79.475) * 100% = 90.91%.\n\nHowever, we need to remember that John started with 50% strong milk tea, which means the concentration of tea in the initial solution was 50%. So, we need to take into account the dilution caused by the milk replacements. Each time John replaced 15% of the solution with milk, he diluted the tea concentration by a factor of 0.85. So, the effective concentration of tea after the two replacements is 50% * 0.85 * 0.85 = 36.13%.\n\nFinally, when John replaced 10% of the resultant solution with more milk, he diluted the tea concentration by a factor of 0.9. So, the effective concentration of tea in the final solution is 36.13% * 0.9 = 32.51%. The answer is (E).", "pred_strict": "E", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "E"}

Find the average speed of the plane around the field?\nChoices: (A)384 (B)562 (C)458 (D)156 (E)452\nAnswer:", "output": "The average speed of the plane around the field is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. Since the plane travels along each side of the square, the total distance traveled is 4 times the length of one side of the square. Let's assume the length of one side of the square is x km. Then the total distance traveled is 4x km.\n\nTo find the total time taken, we need to divide the distance traveled on each side by the speed at which the plane travels on that side. The time taken to travel along the first side (at 200 km/hr) is x/200 hours. The time taken to travel along the second side (at 400 km/hr) is x/400 hours. Similarly, the time taken to travel along the third and fourth sides are x/600 and x/800 hours respectively. Therefore, the total time taken is:\n\nx/200 + x/400 + x/600 + x/800\n\nTo simplify this expression, we need to find the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 2400. Then we can write:\n\nx/200 + x/400 + x/600 + x/800 = (12x + 6x + 4x + 3x)/2400 = 25x/2400\n\nTherefore, the total time taken is 25x/2400 hours.\n\nNow we can find the average speed of the plane around the field:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\n= 4x / (25x/2400)\n= 384 km/hr\n\nThe answer is (A).", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "A"}

Working together, both hoses can fill 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours, which means they can fill 1/4 of the pool in 3/4 hours. So in 1 hour, both hoses can fill 1/4 divided by 3/4 = 1/3 of the pool. Since hose A can fill 1/8 of the pool in 1 hour, we know that hose B can fill 1/3 - 1/8 = 5/24 of the pool in 1 hour. So it would take hose B 24/5 = 4.8 hours to fill the entire pool alone.

There are 90 two-digit numbers from 10 to 99. There are 401 three-digit numbers from 100 to 500. 9 + 90(2) + 401(3) = 1392.

It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\nChoices: (A)438 (B)550 (C)500 (D)450 (E)498\nAnswer:", "output": "The total number of cubes in the larger cube is 5*5*5 = 125. The number of cubes on the surface (excluding the inner layer) is (5-2)*(5-2)*6 = 36*6 = 216. Each of these cubes has 5 faces that need to be painted, so the total number of faces that need to be painted is 216*5 = 1080. The number of cubes that have at least one face painted is (5-2)*(5-2)*6 - (5-2)*(5-2)*(6-2) = 144. Therefore, the number of faces that remain unpainted is 125*6 - 1080 + 144*1 = 750 - 936 = -186. This is not a possible answer, so we made an error in our calculations. Checking our work, we realize that we forgot to subtract the faces on the inner layer of cubes. The number of cubes on the inner layer is (5-2-2)*(5-2-2)*6 = 36, and each of these cubes has 4 unpainted faces. So the total number of unpainted faces is 750 - 1080 + 144*1 - 36*4 = 750 - 1080 + 144 - 144 = -330. Again, this is not a possible answer, so we made another error. Checking our work again, we realize that we forgot to subtract the faces on the edges of the inner layer of cubes. There are 12 edges on the inner layer, and each edge has 2 cubes that share it, so there are 24 cubes on the edges of the inner layer. Each of these cubes has 3 unpainted faces. So the total number of unpainted faces is 750 - 1080 + 144 - 72 = -258. This is still not a possible answer, so we made another error. Checking our work again, we realize that we forgot to subtract the faces on the corners of the inner layer of cubes. There are 8 corners on the inner layer, and each corner has 3 cubes that share it, so there are 24 cubes on the corners of the inner layer. Each of these cubes has 2 unpainted faces. So the total number of unpainted faces is 750 - 1080 + 144 - 72 + 48 = -210. This is still not a possible answer, so we made another error. Checking our work again, we realize that we made a mistake in our calculation of the number of cubes on the edges of the inner layer. There are actually 16 edges on the inner layer, not 12. So the total number of unpainted faces is 750 - 1080 + 144 - 96 + 48 = -234. This is still not a possible answer, so we made another error. Checking our work again, we realize that we made a mistake in our calculation of the number of cubes on the corners of the inner layer. There are actually 8 corners on the inner layer, not 4.

Then R's age is x + (x - T) = 2x - T and T's age is (2x - T) - x = x - T. We know that R + T = 50, so (2x - T) + (x - T) = 50, which simplifies to 3x - 2T = 50. We also know that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T, so R - Q = Q - T. Substituting R = 2x - T and T = x - Q, we get (2x - T) - x = x - T - Q, which simplifies to x - Q = x - 2T. Rearranging, we get Q - 2T = -T. Adding this equation to 3x - 2T = 50, we get Q + x = 50, which means Q = 50 - x. Substituting this into Q - 2T = -T, we get 50 - x - 2T = -T, which simplifies to T = (x - 50) / 2. Now we can find R - Q: R - Q = (2x - T) - x = x + T = x + (x - 50) / 2.

Each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents, so we can travel 35 additional quarter-miles for $3.50. Therefore, we can travel a total of 36 quarter-miles (or 9 miles) with the remaining $3.50.\n\nAdding the distances we can travel with $5 and $3.50, we get a total distance of 13 miles. However, we still have 50 cents left, which can buy us an additional 5 quarter-miles (or 1.25 miles). Therefore, the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is 14.25 miles.

Find the distance when they meet from starting point.\nChoices: (A)238 (B)289 (C)200 (D)287 (E)187\nAnswer:", "output": "Let's call the speed of the ship \"s\" and the time it takes for them to meet \"t\". We know that the plane travels 10s for the same amount of time, so its distance traveled is 10s*t. We also know that the total distance traveled by both the ship and the plane is 180 + 10s*t. Since they meet at the same point, we can set these two distances equal to each other:\n\n180 + 10s*t = s*t\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n180 = s*t - 10s*t\n180 = t*s*(1-10)\n180 = -9s*t\n-20 = s*t\n\nNow we can substitute this value of -20 for s*t in either of the original equations to find the total distance traveled:\n\n180 + 10s*t = 180 + 10(-20) = 180 - 200 = -20\n\nSince distance cannot be negative, we made an error somewhere in our calculations. Checking back, we see that we made a mistake in our simplification of the equation. It should be:\n\n180 = s*t + 10s*t\n\nSimplifying this correctly, we get:\n\n180 = s*t*(1+10)\n180 = 11s*t\n16.36 = s*t\n\nNow we can substitute this value of 16.36 for s*t in either of the original equations to find the total distance traveled:\n\n180 + 10s*t = 180 + 10(16.36) = 340.6\n\nThe distance traveled from the starting point is 340.6 miles.

Then the ages of the members form an arithmetic sequence with first term 7 and common difference 3/12 (since the common difference is in months). The sum of an arithmetic sequence is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so we have:\n\n250 = (7 + (n-1)(3/12))/2 * n\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n1000 = 7n + 3/4 * n^2 - 3/4 * n\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4, we get:\n\n4000 = 28n + 3n^2 - 3n\n\nRearranging and factoring, we get:\n\n3n^2 + 25n - 4000 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nn = (-25 \u00b1 sqrt(25^2 + 4*3*4000))/6\n\nn = (-25 \u00b1 205)/6\n\nSince n must be a positive integer, we take the positive root:\n\nn = (-25 + 205)/6 = 30/6 = 5\n\nTherefore, there are 5 members in the club.

If it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies starting from 1 lily, then $2^{60/2} = 2^{30}$ lilies are needed. If there are initially 64 lilies, then we need $2^{30} - 64$ more lilies. We can find the number of days it takes for the number of lilies to double by solving $2^{n/2} = 2 \\cdot 64 = 128$, which gives $n = 6$.

Then, 75 of them take a winter vacation, and 25 do not. Out of the 75 who take a winter vacation, 40 also take a summer vacation, leaving 35 who only take a winter vacation. This means that there are 25 employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. \n\nNow, we need to find what percent of the total number of employees (100) this represents. We know that 20 percent take neither vacation, so 80 percent take at least one vacation. Therefore, the 25 employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation represent 25/80 or 31.25 percent of the employees who take at least one vacation. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the percentage of all employees (not just those who take a vacation) who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. Since we assumed that there are 100 employees in the company, and 20 percent (or 20 employees) do not take any vacation, the 25 employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation represent 25/(100-20) or 31.25 percent of all employees. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 25%.", "pred_strict": "C", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "A"}

If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B?\nChoices: (A)45 (B)48 (C)51 (D)54 (E)57\nAnswer:", "output": "We can use the formula distance = rate x time. Let's call the time it takes for the ants to meet each other \"t\". Since they are moving towards each other, we can add their speeds to get their combined speed, which is 9 + 6 = 15 cm per hour. So we have:\n\ndistance = rate x time\ndistance = 15 cm/hr x t\n\nWe also know that the total distance they need to cover is 75 cm. Since they are moving towards each other, they will meet in the middle, so each ant needs to travel half the distance, which is 75/2 = 37.5 cm. Let's use ant A as our reference point and find out how long it takes for ant A to travel 37.5 cm:\n\ndistance = rate x time\n37.5 cm = 9 cm/hr x t\nt = 37.5/9 hours\n\nNow we can plug this value of \"t\" into our first equation to find out how far ant A travels:\n\ndistance = 15 cm/hr x t\ndistance = 15 cm/hr x (37.5/9) hours\ndistance = 62.5 cm\n\nSo ant A travels 62.5 cm before meeting ant B.

Then, using the formula for simple interest, the interest earned after 2 years would be 5000*r*2 = 10000r. Using the formula for compound interest, the interest earned after 2 years would be 5000*(1+r)^2 - 5000 = 5000r^2 + 10000r. The difference between these two amounts is 5000r^2 + 5000r = 5000r(r+1). We know that this difference is equal to 72, so we can set up the equation 5000r(r+1) = 72 and solve for r. Simplifying, we get r^2 + r - 0.0144 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, we get r = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 0.0576))/2 or r = (-1 - sqrt(1 + 0.0576))/2.

We know that V + W + B = 250 and W = 2.5B. We also know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so V + B = 125.\n\nSubstituting W = 2.5B into the first equation, we get V + 3.5B = 250. Substituting V + B = 125 into this equation, we get 2V + 4B = 250.

Then 40 of them were men and 60 were women. Out of the 40 men, 75% preferred red cars, which is 30 men. That means that 10 men preferred green cars. So out of the total 100 people, 30+10=40 preferred green cars. We can set up a proportion to find out how many people out of the total 100 preferred red cars: \n\n30/40 = x/100 \n\nSolving for x, we get x = 75. So out of the total 100 people, 75 preferred red cars and 25 preferred green cars. \n\nBut we know that 60% of the people who took the survey were women, which means that 60 out of the total 100 people were women. So we can set up another proportion to find out how many women preferred red cars: \n\n45/60 = x/100 \n\nSolving for x, we get x = 75. So out of the total 100 people, 75 preferred red cars and 25 preferred green cars, and 45 of those who preferred red cars were women. \n\nNow we can set up one more proportion to find out how many men preferred red cars: \n\n30/40 = x/y \n\nwhere y is the total number of men who took the survey. Solving for y, we get y = 40(30/x). We know that 10 men preferred green cars, so the total number of men who preferred red cars is 30 - 10 = 20. So we can set up another proportion: \n\n20/y = 30/x \n\nSolving for y, we get y = 60. \n\nSo out of the total 100 people who took the survey, 60% were women (60 people) and 40% were men (40 people). 20 men preferred red cars and 10 men preferred green cars.

But x must be less than N, so this is not possible. Therefore, N = 1397 and x+1 = 1, which means x = 0. So N leaves a remainder of 0 when dividing into both 2272 and 875. The sum of the digits of N is 1+3+9+7 = 20, which is not one of the answer choices. However, we can simplify it to 2+0 = 2, which is equivalent to answer choice (A).

We know that $x+y+9=37$, so $x+y=28$. The area of the rectangle is $xy$, so we want to find $xy$. We can use the fact that $(x+y)^2=x^2+2xy+y^2$ to find $xy$. We know that $(x+y)^2=28^2=784$ and $x^2+y^2=(x+y)^2-2xy=784-2xy$. We also know that $(x+y)^2=x^2+2xy+y^2$ is equal to $2xy+81$, since $x+y=28$ and $9^2=81$. So we have $2xy+81=784$, which means $2xy=703$. Therefore, $xy=\\frac{703}{2}$.

When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father?\nChoices: (A)45 (B)48 (C)50 (D)55 (E)58\nAnswer:", "output": "Let's call Joe's age J, his sister's age S, and his father's age F. We know that J + S + F = 100. \n\nWe also know that when J = F, S = 2S (since she will be twice as old as she is now). Simplifying that equation, we get S = 0, which doesn't make sense. So we made an error somewhere. Let's try the second sentence again: \n\n\"When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.\" \n\nLet's call the age when Joe is as old as his father \"x\". At that point, his father will be F + x years old, and his sister will be S + x years old. We know that when S + x = 2(F - S), or S + x = 2F - 2S. \n\nWe can use the first equation to solve for F in terms of J and S: F = 100 - J - S. Substituting that into the second equation, we get S + x = 2(100 - J - S) - 2S, which simplifies to S + x = 200 - 2J. \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables: J + S + F = 100 and S + x = 200 - 2J. We can solve for S in the second equation: S = 200 - 2J - x. Substituting that into the first equation, we get J + (200 - 2J - x) + (100 - J - (200 - 2J - x)) = 100, which simplifies to J + x = 50. \n\nSo when Joe is as old as his father, their ages will add up to 50. We also know that F + x = 2(S - x), or F = 2S - x. Substituting S = 200 - 2J - x, we get F = 400 - 4J - 2x - x, or F = 400 - 5J - 3x. \n\nWe don't know J, S, or x, but we can use the fact that their ages add up to 100 to eliminate one variable. From J + S + F = 100, we know that S = 100 - J - F. Substituting that into S = 200 - 2J - x, we get 100 - J - F = 200 - 2J - x, or F = J + x - 100. \n\nSubstituting that into F = 400 - 5J - 3x, we get J + x - 100 = 400 - 5J - 3x, or 6J + 4x = 500. We also know that J + x = 50, so we can solve for J and x: \n\nJ + x = 50 \n\n6J + 4x = 500 \n\nMultiplying the first equation by 4 and subtracting it from the second equation, we get 2J = 300, or J = 150. Substituting that into J + x = 50, we get x = -100. \n\nThat doesn't make sense, so we made an error somewhere. Let's go back to the equation S + x = 200 - 2J. We know that S is less than 100 (since J + S + F = 100), so x must be greater than 100. Let's try x = 120: \n\nS + 120 = 200 - 2J \n\nS = 80 - 2J \n\nJ + S + F = 100 \n\nJ + (80 - 2J) + F = 100 \n\nF = J + 20 \n\nF + 120 = 2(S - 120) \n\nF = 2S - 240 \n\nSubstituting F = J + 20 and S = 80 - 2J into the second equation, we get J + 140 = 4J + 160, or J = 10. \n\nSubstituting J = 10 into F = J + 20, we get F = 30.

We can solve for W in terms of L from the first equation: W = 240/L. Substituting this into the second equation, we get 2L + 240/L + 10. To minimize the amount of fencing needed, we want to find the value of L that minimizes this expression. Taking the derivative and setting it equal to 0, we get 2 - 240/L^2 = 0, which means L = 20.

Their product is 242*243*244 = 1417244. To find the sum of three consecutive integers whose product is 1417244, we can use the fact that the product of three consecutive integers is equal to n(n+1)(n+2), where n is the middle integer. So we want to solve the equation n(n+1)(n+2) = 1417244. We can estimate that n is around 50, since 50*51*52 is close to 1417244. Trying n=50, we get 50*51*52 = 132600, which is too small. Trying n=51, we get 51*52*53 = 140556, which is also too small. Trying n=52, we get 52*53*54 = 148176, which is too large. So n must be between 51 and 52. We can try n=51.5, which gives approximately 51.5*52.5*53.5 = 1417244.125, which is very close to 1417244.

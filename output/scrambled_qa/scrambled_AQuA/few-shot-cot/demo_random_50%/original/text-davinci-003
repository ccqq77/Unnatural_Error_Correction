The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\nChoices: (A)5(\u221a3 + 1) (B)6(\u221a3 + \u221a2) (C)7(\u221a3 \u2013 1) (D)8(\u221a3 \u2013 2) (E)None of these\nAnswer:", "output": " The time taken for the car to reach the base of the tower can be calculated using the formula t = d/v, where t is the time taken, d is the distance to the base of the tower and v is the speed of the car. Since the angle of elevation changed from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 in 10 minutes, the distance traveled in that time can be calculated using the formula d = vtcos\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle of elevation. So the distance traveled in 10 minutes is vtcos45\u00b0. The total distance to the base of the tower is vtcos60\u00b0. So the time taken to reach the base of the tower is vtcos60\u00b0/vtcos45\u00b0 = (\u221a3 + 1)t. So the time taken to reach the base of the tower is 5(\u221a3 + 1) minutes.

The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so the discounted price is $1.90 more than 39% of the original price. So 78% of the original price + $1.90 = 39% of the original price. This simplifies to 78% + 39% = 117% of the original price. So the original price is $1.90 / 117% = $1.62. The original price of the item is $1.62 / 0.78 = $2.08.

Since B invested 60,000, his share of the profit would be 60,000 / 220,000 * 717,500 = 150,000. This means that C must have invested 120,000 / (220,000 - 60,000) * 717,500 = 150,000.

Let's call the number of passing students x and the number of failing students y. Then x + y = total number of students in the class. We also know that the average of the passing students is 83 and the average of the failing students is 55. So the overall class average is (83x + 55y) / (x + y) = 76. Solving for x, we get x = (76(x + y) - 55y) / 83. Substituting x + y for the total number of students in the class, we get x = (76(2y) - 55y) / 83. Simplifying, we get x = (152 - 55y) / 83. Since x is the number of passing students, the percent of the class that passed is x / (x + y) * 100. Substituting x and y, we get (152 - 55y) / (2y) * 100. Simplifying, we get 76 - 27.5y / y * 100. Since y is the number of failing students, the percent of the class that passed is 76 - 27.5y / y * 100. Since y is greater than 0, the percent of the class that passed is greater than 76.

Find the age of Joe's father?\nChoices: (A)45 (B)48 (C)50 (D)55 (E)58\nAnswer:", "output": " Let Joe's age be x, his sister's age be y and his father's age be z. Then x + y + z = 100. When Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as now, so y + 2x = z. When Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father, so z = 2y. Substituting y + 2x = z into x + y + z = 100, we get 3x + 3y = 100. Substituting y + 2x = z and z = 2y into 3x + 3y = 100, we get 5x = 50. So x = 10 and y = 20. Therefore, z = 70. The age of Joe's father is 70.

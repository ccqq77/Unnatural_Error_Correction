There are 90 two-digit numbers from 10 to 99. There are 401 three-digit numbers from 100 to 500. 9 + 90(2) + 401(3) = 1392.

The distance from the arc to the base of the electric tower is decreasing as the angle increases from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. This means that the rate of change of the distance is negative. We can use the Mean Value Theorem to find the average rate of change of the distance over this interval:\n\naverage rate of change = (distance at 60\u00b0 - distance at 45\u00b0) / (60\u00b0 - 45\u00b0)\naverage rate of change = (10 - 0) / 15\naverage rate of change = 2/3\n\nThis means that the distance is decreasing at an average rate of 2/3 units per degree. To find how much more time it will take for the arc to reach the base of the tower, we need to find how much more distance it needs to cover. Let x be the additional distance it needs to cover, in the same units as before. Then:\n\n2/3 = -dx/d\u03b8\ndx = -2/3 d\u03b8\n\nWe want to find how much more time it will take for the arc to cover this additional distance. Let t be the additional time it will take, in the same units as before. Then:\n\ndx/dt = 20 (given)\n-2/3 d\u03b8/dt = 20\nd\u03b8/dt = -30/\u03b8\n\nWe can solve this separable differential equation by integrating both sides:\n\n\u222b d\u03b8/\u03b8 = \u222b -30 dt\nln|\u03b8| = -30t + C\n|\u03b8| = e^(-30t+C)\n|\u03b8| = Ce^(-30t)\n\nWe can determine the value of C by using the initial condition that the angle is 45\u00b0 when the distance is 0:\n\n|\u03b8| = 0 when \u03b8 = 45\u00b0\n0 = Ce^(-30t)\nC = 0\n\nSo the equation for the angle as a function of time is:\n\n\u03b8 = -45 e^(-30t)\n\nWe want to find how much more time it will take for the arc to cover the additional distance x. We know that the arc covers a distance of \u03b8/45 times the height of the tower, so:\n\nx = (\u03b8/45)h\n\nSubstituting the equation for \u03b8, we get:\n\nx = (-h/45) 45 e^(-30t)\nx = -h e^(-30t)\n\nWe want to find the value of t when x = h, which means the arc has reached the base of the tower. So:\n\nh = -h e^(-30t)\ne^(-30t) = -1\nThis has no real solutions, so the answer is None of these.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "", "GT": "A"}

We know that the company sells all of the produced components by the end of each month, so the total revenue each month is simply the number of components produced multiplied by the selling price of each component. Let's call the minimum selling price we're looking for \"x\". \n\nWe know that the company produces 420 components each month, so the total revenue each month is 420x. We also know that the profit from each component is $110, so the total profit each month is 420($110) = $46,200. \n\nWe're told that the minimum total revenue needed to ensure a profit is $626,400, so we can set up the equation: \n\n420x = $626,400 + $46,200 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n420x = $672,600 \n\nx = $672,600 / 420 \n\nx = $1601/3 \n\nWe need to round up to the nearest cent to ensure that the minimum revenue is met, so the minimum selling price per component is $1601.34. \n\nTo check, we can calculate the total revenue: \n\n420($1601.34) = $672,600 \n\nAnd we can calculate the total profit: \n\n420($110) = $46,200 \n\nSo the total revenue minus the total production cost is indeed $626,400. \n\nTherefore, the minimum selling price per component that will ensure the minimum total revenue is met is $1601.34, which rounded up to the nearest dollar is $1602.

We know that x + y = 35, and that Alex takes 7 hours to make a yot while Jacob takes 9 hours. This means that in the same amount of time, Alex can make 9/7 yots while Jacob can make 7/9 yots. We can set up the equation:\n\n9/7x = 7/9y\n\nMultiplying both sides by 63 (the least common multiple of 7 and 9) gives us:\n\n81x = 49y\n\nWe know that x + y = 35, so we can substitute y = 35 - x into the equation above:\n\n81x = 49(35 - x)\n\nSolving for x gives us x = 15. Therefore, Alex worked for 15 yots in a month. To find out how many of those yots were worked on by Jacob, we can use the equation y = 35 - x, which gives us y = 20. So Jacob worked for 20 yots in a month. We want to find out how many of those yots were worked on for at least 16 hours, which means we need to find the number of yots that took Jacob more than 16 hours to make. Since Jacob takes 9 hours to make a yot, any yot that took him more than 16 hours to make must be one that he didn't finish in the same month. We know that he worked on 20 yots in a month, so the answer is 20 - the number of yots he finished in the same month. Since he takes 9 hours to make a yot, he can finish at most 20/9 yots in a month. Therefore, he finished at most 18 yots in the same month, so the answer is 20 - 18 = 2. Therefore, Jacob worked on 2 yots for at least 16 hours.

The second number (y) is less than or equal to the square root of the first number. So we can start by finding the number of perfect squares between 0 and 100, which is 10 (0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100). \n\nFor each of these perfect squares, the possible values of y are 0, 1, 2, 3, up to the square root of the perfect square. So for example, if x is 16, then y can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nTo find the expected value of y for each x, we can take the sum of all possible values of y for that x, divided by the total number of possible values of y (which is the square root of x). So for x = 0, the expected value of y is 0/1 = 0. For x = 1, the expected value of y is (0+1)/2 = 0.5. For x = 4, the expected value of y is (0+1+2)/3 = 1. \n\nWe can continue this process for all 10 perfect squares between 0 and 100, and then take the weighted average of the expected values of y, with weights equal to the number of times each perfect square appears. \n\nThe calculations are as follows: \n\n- For x = 0, the expected value of y is 0/1 = 0. This occurs once. \n- For x = 1, the expected value of y is (0+1)/2 = 0.5. This occurs once. \n- For x = 4, the expected value of y is (0+1+2)/3 = 1. This occurs once. \n- For x = 9, the expected value of y is (0+1+2+3)/4 = 1.5. This occurs once. \n- For x = 16, the expected value of y is (0+1+2+3+4)/5 = 2. This occurs once. \n- For x = 25, the expected value of y is (0+1+2+3+4+5)/6 = 2.5. This occurs once. \n- For x = 36, the expected value of y is (0+1+2+3+4+5+6)/7 = 3. This occurs once. \n- For x = 49, the expected value of y is (0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7)/8 = 3.5. This occurs once. \n- For x = 64, the expected value of y is (0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8)/9 = 4. This occurs once. \n- For x = 81, the expected value of y is (0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9)/10 = 4.5. This occurs once. \n\nThe weighted average of these expected values is: \n\n(0*1 + 0.5*1 + 1*1 + 1.5*1 + 2*1 + 2.5*1 + 3*1 + 3.5*1 + 4*1 + 4.5*1) / 10 = 2.75 \n\nSo the answer is approximately (C) (2.75, 7).", "pred_strict": "C", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "A"}

Similarly, Mr. Black can complete 1/8 of a watch in 1 day, and Mr. Blue can complete 1/12 of a watch in 1 day. Together, they can complete 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = 11/24 of a watch in 1 day. So it will take them 24/11 days to complete 1 watch. \n\nAfter 8 days, Mr. Brown has completed 8/6 = 4/3 of a watch. After 8 days, Mr. Black has completed 8/8 = 1 watch.

This means they have 1 - 7/3 = 2/3 of a watch left to complete. \n\nTo find out how many days it will take Mr. Blue to complete the remaining 2/3 of a watch, we can set up the equation (1/12)x = 2/3, where x is the number of days it will take Mr. Blue. Solving for x, we get x = 8. So it will take Mr. Blue 8 days to complete the remaining 2/3 of a watch. \n\nTherefore, the total number of days it will take all three of them to complete the contract is 8 + 8 = 16 days.

We know that 2l + 2w = 150 + 4w, since the length is 1 meter more than the width. Simplifying this equation, we get 2l - 2w = 150. We also know that the length and width are integers, so we can factor the left side of the equation as 2(l-w). Since 150 is divisible by 2 and 3, and we want the difference between the length and width to be as small as possible, we can try dividing 150 by 6 to get 25. Therefore, l-w = 25, and adding w to both sides gives us l = w + 25. Substituting this into the equation 2l + 2w = 150, we get 2(w+25) + 2w = 150, which simplifies to 4w = 100 and w = 25. Therefore, l = 50. The perimeter is 2l + 2w = 2(50) + 2(25) = 150, so the interpretation of the problem is that the rectangle has dimensions 50m x 25m. Adding 1 meter to the width gives us a new width of 26m, and the new perimeter is 2(50) + 2(26) = 152m. Therefore, the answer is (D) 63m.", "pred_strict": "D", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "C"}

To ensure that both yields meet their minimum requirements, we need to take the maximum of the two percentages, which is 9%. So for every 100 units of the health food formula, we can only get 9 units of vitamin E and 8 units of vitamin A. To achieve the minimum required yield of both vitamins, we need to find the LCM of 9 and 8, which is 72. So for every 72 units of the health food formula, we can get 9 units of vitamin E and 8 units of vitamin A. Therefore, the ratio of vitamin E to vitamin A is 9:8. \n\nTo obtain the minimum required yield of both vitamins, we need to find the maximum possible yield of the health food formula. This occurs when we take the LCM of the yields of vitamin E and vitamin A, which is 72. So for every 72 units of the health food formula, we can get 9 units of vitamin E and 8 units of vitamin A. Therefore, the total yield of the health food formula is 9 + 8 = 17 units per 72 units of the formula. \n\nTo obtain the minimum required yield of both vitamins for 500 units of the health food formula, we need to divide 500 by 72 and round up to the nearest integer, since we can't have a fraction of a batch. This gives us 7 batches of 72 units and 44 extra units. So we need a total of 7 batches of the health food formula, which is 7 * 72 = 504 units. Therefore, the minimum amount of the health food formula needed to produce the required yields of both vitamins is 504 units. \n\nTo find the range of the yield percentage of the health food formula, we need to find the maximum possible yield of the formula and the minimum possible yield of the formula. The maximum possible yield occurs when all the ingredients are at their maximum yield percentages. The maximum yield percentage for vitamin E is 12%, and the maximum yield percentage for vitamin A is 10%. So for every 100 units of the health food formula, we can get 12 units of vitamin E and 10 units of vitamin A. To achieve the maximum possible yield of both vitamins, we need to find the LCM of 12 and 10, which is 60. So for every 60 units of the health food formula, we can get 12 units of vitamin E and 10 units of vitamin A. Therefore, the ratio of vitamin E to vitamin A is 6:5. \n\nTo obtain the maximum possible yield of the health food formula, we need to find the LCM of the yields of vitamin E and vitamin A, which is 60. So for every 60 units of the health food formula, we can get 12 units of vitamin E and 10 units of vitamin A. Therefore, the total yield of the health food formula is 12 + 10 = 22 units per 60 units of the formula. \n\nTo obtain the maximum possible yield of both vitamins for 500 units of the health food formula, we need to divide 500 by 60 and round up to the nearest integer. This gives us 9 batches of 60 units and 20 extra units. So we need a total of 9 batches of the health food formula, which is 9 * 60 = 540 units. Therefore, the maximum amount of the health food formula needed to produce the required yields of both vitamins is 540 units. \n\nThe range of the yield percentage of the health food formula is the difference between the maximum possible yield and the minimum possible yield, divided by the minimum possible yield, expressed as a percentage. \n\nMaximum possible yield = 22 units per 60 units of the formula = 36.67% yield \nMinimum possible yield = 17 units per 72 units of the formula = 23.61% yield \n\nRange of yield percentage = (36.67 - 23.61) / 23.61 * 100% = 55.23% \n\nTherefore, the range of the yield percentage of the health food formula is 55.23%.

Since it is split into 6 equal parts, each part is x/6. When it is split into 2 unequal parts, let the larger part be kx and the smaller part be (1-k)x. We know that the average of these two parts is still x/6, so we can set up the equation:\n\n(kx + (1-k)x)/2 = x/6\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nk = 2/5\n\nSo the larger part is 2/5 of the total amount of fuel, or 2/5 * x. The smaller part is 3/5 of the total amount of fuel, or 3/5 * x. We want to find how many times the larger part is greater than the smaller part, so we set up the ratio:\n\n(2/5 * x) / (3/5 * x) = 2/3\n\nSo the larger part is 2/3 times greater than the smaller part. Now we need to find how many pairs of parts there are, which is just the number of ways to choose 2 parts out of 6:\n\n6 choose 2 = 15\n\nSo there are 15 pairs of parts. Multiplying the ratio by the number of pairs, we get:\n\n(2/3) * 15 = 10\n\nSo the larger part is 10 times greater than the smaller part. Therefore, if there are 10 parts of fuel that are paid for with a discount, there are 6 - 10 = -4 parts of fuel that are paid for at full price, which doesn't make sense.

Let the distance between the two trains be $d$. Then the train on the main line travels $\\frac{1}{6}d$ before the train on the branch line starts, and the train on the branch line travels $d - \\frac{1}{6}d = \\frac{5}{6}d$ to catch up to the main line train.\n\nSince the train on the branch line travels at a rate of $\\frac{1}{10}$ of the distance between the two trains per minute, it takes $\\frac{\\frac{5}{6}d}{\\frac{1}{10}d} = \\frac{50}{6} = \\frac{25}{3}$ minutes to catch up to the main line train. Therefore, the first train arrives at the intersection $\\frac{25}{3}$ minutes after it starts, or at 5:08 and $\\frac{1}{3}$ minutes.\n\nSince the man arrives at the intersection every day at the same time, he has a 10-minute window to catch the first train. The first train arrives at the intersection at 5:08 and $\\frac{1}{3}$ minutes, so the man has from 5:05 to 5:15 to catch it. Therefore, the probability of him catching the first train is $\\frac{10}{60} = \\frac{1}{6}$.

Since there are now 11 elves in the group, the average weight would be 124.6 / 11 = 11.327 pounds per elf. To find the weight of the heavy duty truck alone, we can subtract the weight of the original 10 elves from the total weight: 124.6 - 122 = 2.6 pounds.

Therefore, M - N = (bac - cab) = (b - c)ac. We also know that M - N + 396c = 990. Substituting M - N = (b - c)ac, we get (b - c)ac + 396c = 990. Factoring out c, we get c(ab + 396) = 990. Since c is a positive integer, ab + 396 must be a factor of 990. The factors of 990 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 15, 18, 22, 30, 33, 45, 55, 66, 90, 99, 110, 165, 198, 330, and 495. We know that ab + 396 > ab, so ab + 396 must be greater than or equal to the smallest factor of 990 that is greater than ab. The smallest such factor is 10, so ab + 396 \u2265 10, which means ab \u2265 -386. Since a, b, and c are digits, we know that a and b are positive integers between 1 and 9, inclusive, and c is a positive integer between 0 and 9, inclusive. Therefore, there are 9 choices for a, 9 choices for b, and 10 choices for c, for a total of 9 x 9 x 10 = 810 possible values of M. Since we know that M > N, we can eliminate the values of M where a \u2264 c. If a = c, then M = bac = bcc = (b + 9)c, which means that M is a multiple of c. Since M > N, we know that c > 0, so M is at least 10c. Therefore, we can eliminate the values of M where M < 10c. The smallest possible value of c is 1, so we can eliminate the values of M where M < 10. The largest possible value of M is 999, so we can eliminate the values of M where M > 999. After eliminating these values, we are left with 20 possible values of M: 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 310, 320. For each of these values of M, we can calculate the corresponding value of N = cab and check if M - N + 396c = 990. We find that the only value of M that works is M = 320, which means that there is only one possible value of N, namely N = 203. Therefore, there is only one possible value of c, namely c = 2. Since M = bac and M > 300, we know that a = 3. Therefore, there are 9 choices for b (since b > c = 2), so there are a total of 9 possible values of M that satisfy the given conditions.

To find the time it takes for them to meet again at the same starting point, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two rates. The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91, so they will meet again after 91 minutes. To find the time it takes for one of them to make one more full rotation than the other, we need to find the difference between the times it takes for them to make 1 full rotation. Ball A takes 13 minutes to make 1 full rotation, and Ball B takes 7 minutes to make 1 full rotation, so the difference is 13 - 7 = 6 minutes. Therefore, they will be at the same starting point again after 91 + 6 = 97 minutes, which is 1 hour and 37 minutes.

Then the number of papers sold on Monday is also \"x\" because they are sold at the same price. The number of papers sold on Tuesday is \"x+1\" because they are sold for $1 more than on Sunday/Monday. Similarly, the number of papers sold on Wednesday is \"x+2\", on Thursday is \"x+3\", on Friday is \"x+4\", and on Saturday is \"x+5\". \n\nSo the total revenue for the week is:\n\n4x + 4(x) + 5(x+1) + 6(x+2) + 7(x+3) + 8(x+4) + 9(x+5) = 210\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n36x + 110 = 210\n\n36x = 100\n\nx = 100/36\n\nx \u2248 2.78\n\nSo the number of papers sold on Monday (and Sunday) is approximately 2.78.

If each amount is reversed, the total amount received would still be Rs 8600. So the sum of the original amounts and the reversed amounts is 2 * Rs 8600 = Rs 17200. \n\nIf each amount is reversed, the difference between the original amount and the reversed amount is 9 times the difference between the digits in the original number. So the total difference between the original amounts and the reversed amounts is (5 * 9) + (4 * 9) + (2 * 9 * 10) = 261. \n\nLet the sum of the original amounts be x. Then the sum of the reversed amounts is also x. So the total amount received is 2x. And the total difference between the original amounts and the reversed amounts is 261. \n\nSo we can write the equation: \n\n2x - x = 261 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\nx = 261 \n\nSo the sum of the original amounts is Rs 261. \n\nIf each amount is reversed, the sum of the reversed amounts is also Rs 261. So the sum of the amounts received after reversing is Rs 522. \n\nThe difference between the original amount and the reversed amount is 9 times the difference between the digits in the original number. So the total difference between the original amounts and the reversed amounts is (5 * 9) + (4 * 9) + (2 * 9 * 10) = 261. \n\nSo the sum of the differences between the original amounts and the reversed amounts is 261. \n\nIf each amount is reversed, the total number of notes received is still 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. So the average difference between the original amounts and the reversed amounts is 261 / 11 = 23.727. \n\nSo the amount received from each note is Rs 23.727. \n\nThe amount received from each note after reversing is 5 * Rs 23.727 = Rs 118.635. \n\nSo the total amount received after reversing is 118.635 * 11 = Rs 1304.985. \n\nSo the total amount received is Rs 8600 + Rs 1304.985 = Rs 9904.985. \n\nSo the amount received by the man is Rs 9904.985. \n\nRounding off to the nearest Rs 100, we get Rs 9900. \n\nSo the answer is (E) Rs 800.", "pred_strict": "E", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "E"}

So the amount each person will have to contribute if 3 people are contributing is D/3, and the amount each person will have to contribute if M people are contributing is D/M. To find the amount each person will have to contribute if M people are contributing and 3 people are already contributing, we need to subtract the amount that the 3 people are already contributing (which is D/3) from the total cost of the gift (which is D), and then divide by the remaining number of people (which is M-3).

The distance that Train A travels is 11 km * 40 km/hr = 440 km. The distance that Train B travels is 2 km * 72 km/hr = 144 km. So the distance between the two trains is 440 km - 144 km = 296 km.\n\nNow let's find the time it takes for the two trains to meet. We can use the formula distance = rate * time. Let's call the time it takes for the two trains to meet \"t\". Then we have:\n\n440 km/hr * t + 144 km/hr * t = 296 km\n584t = 296\nt = 0.51 hours\n\nSo the two trains will meet in 0.51 hours, or 30.6 minutes.

Let's call this group \"Summer Only\" and \"Winter Only\". \n\n[asy]\nlabel(\"Winter\", (0,70));\nlabel(\"Summer\", (70,70));\ndraw(Circle((30,40), 25));\ndraw(Circle((60,40), 25));\nlabel(\"Other\", (45,40));\nlabel(\"Summer Only\", (75,40));\nlabel(\"Winter Only\", (15,40));\n[/asy]\n\nFrom the information given, we know that 75% of people take a vacation of some sort. This means that 25% of people are in the \"Other\" group. \n\nLet's call the percentage of people who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation \"S\". Similarly, let's call the percentage of people who take a winter vacation but not a summer vacation \"W\". \n\nWe know that:\n\n- S + W + 20% = 75% (since 75% of people take a vacation of some sort, and 40% take a winter vacation or a summer vacation)\n- S + W = 55% (subtracting 20% from both sides)\n\nWe want to find the percentage of people who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, which is just S. \n\nTo solve for S, we can use the fact that the sum of the percentages of all the groups in the Venn diagram must add up to 100%. So:\n\nS + W + 20% + 25% = 100%\nS + W = 55%\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n\n20% + 25% = 45% = W\n\nSubstituting this value back into the second equation, we get:\n\nS + 45% = 55%\nS = 10%\n\nSo the percentage of people who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 10%.

This distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length x and y, where x is the distance traveled parallel to the ground and y is the distance traveled perpendicular to the ground. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have x^2 + y^2 = 300^2. \n\nAfter 30 seconds, the ant has traveled a distance of 300/10 = 30 cm along the circumference of a circle with radius 10 cm. This angle is equal to 30/10 = 3 radians. \n\nThe tangent of the angle formed by the ant's path and the radius of the circle is equal to y/x. So we have tan(theta) = y/x, where theta is the angle formed by the ant's path and the radius of the circle. \n\nSolving for y/x, we get y/x = tan(theta) = sin(theta)/cos(theta) = (10/2pi) * 3 / (10/2pi) * sqrt(1 - (3/(10/2pi))^2) = 3/sqrt(4pi^2 - 9). \n\nThe distance traveled perpendicular to the ground is y = x * y/x = x * 3/sqrt(4pi^2 - 9). Substituting this into the Pythagorean theorem equation, we get x^2 + (x * 3/sqrt(4pi^2 - 9))^2 = 300^2. \n\nSolving for x, we get x = 300 / sqrt(1 + 9/(4pi^2 - 9)) = 300sqrt(4pi^2 - 9) / (4pi^2). \n\nThe distance traveled perpendicular to the ground is y = x * 3/sqrt(4pi^2 - 9) = 900 / (4pi^2). \n\nThe area covered by the ant is equal to the area of a sector of the circle with radius 10 cm and central angle 3 radians, minus the area of the right triangle formed by the ant's path. \n\nThe area of the sector is (3/2) * 10^2 * pi = 150pi. The area of the right triangle is (1/2) * x * y = (1/2) * (300sqrt(4pi^2 - 9) / (4pi^2)) * (900 / (4pi^2)) = 10125 / (16pi^4). \n\nSo the area covered by the ant is 150pi - 10125 / (16pi^4) = (2400pi^5 - 10125) / (16pi^4). \n\nSimplifying this expression, we get (750pi - 315) / 4.

The ratio of X to Y in Z is 40:60 or 2:3, so there are 40/100 * 77 = 30.8 marbles of X and 60/100 * 154 = 92.4 marbles of Y in Z. \n\nThe ratio of marbles of X to marbles of Y in Z is 30.8:92.4 or 2:6.

We know that x + y = the total number of candy pieces she bought. We also know that 0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40. We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 100 to get 20x + 25y = 340. \n\nNow we need to find the minimum number of penny candies she bought, which means we need to maximize the number of nickel candies she bought. Let's start by assuming she bought all nickel candies, which would mean y = the total number of candy pieces she bought. Plugging this into our equation, we get 25(total number of candy pieces) = 340, which means the total number of candy pieces she bought is 13.6. Since she can't buy a fraction of a candy piece, this assumption doesn't work. \n\nLet's try assuming she bought all penny candies, which would mean x = the total number of candy pieces she bought. Plugging this into our equation, we get 20(total number of candy pieces) = 340, which means the total number of candy pieces she bought is 17. This assumption works, so the minimum number of penny candies she bought is 17. \n\nBut we need to check if there's another combination of penny and nickel candies that also works. Let's try decreasing the number of penny candies and increasing the number of nickel candies. If we decrease the number of penny candies by 5 and increase the number of nickel candies by 4, the total cost would increase by 0.20(5) - 0.25(4) = 0.05. Since she needs to spend exactly $3.40, she can't buy any more candy pieces without going over budget. Therefore, the minimum number of penny candies she bought is 17, which means she bought 3 nickel candies. The answer is (B).", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "C"}

So, Rs. 260 is equivalent to 260/50 = 5.2 meters. The base of the room is 5.2 meters. \n\nLet the height of the room be 2x and the length be 5x. Then, the volume of the room is (2x)(5x)(5.2) = 52x^2. \n\nWe know that the height to base ratio is 2:5, so 2x/5.2 = 2/5. Solving for x, we get x = 1.3. \n\nTherefore, the height of the room is 2x = 2(1.3) = 2.6 meters. The answer is (A).", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "C"}

Then we have the equation x + (k-1)(-50) = 51, which simplifies to x - 50k = 1. Since we want the sum of the k integers, we need to find x + (-50) + ... + (-50), which is equal to x - 50(k-1). Substituting x - 50k = 1, we get x - 50(k-1) - 50(k-1) = 1, which simplifies to x - 100k + 99 = 0. Factoring, we get (x-1) - 100(k-1) = 0.

Let's assume that the total amount of mixture is 100 grams. Then, there are 30 grams of sand and 70 grams of clay. If we remove x grams of the mixture, then we will have 30 - 0.3x grams of sand and 70 - 0.7x grams of clay. We want these amounts to be equal, so:\n\n30 - 0.3x = 70 - 0.7x\n0.4x = 40\nx = 100/4 = 25\n\nSo we need to remove 25 grams of the mixture. The amount of sand in the remaining mixture is 30 - 0.3(25) = 22.5 grams, and the amount of clay is 70 - 0.7(25) = 52.5 grams. The ratio of sand to clay is 22.5/52.5 = 15/35 = 3/7. To get the ratio of sand to clay in terms of pure sand, we need to divide both sides by 0.3:\n\n(3/7) / 0.3 = 30/7\n\nSo the answer is (C).", "pred_strict": "C", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "B"}

If his income increases by 20%, then his new income is 1.2 times his old income. So his new savings would be 0.3(1.2x) = 0.36x. This is an increase of 0.06x from his old savings of 0.3x. So the percentage increase in his savings is (0.06x / 0.3x) * 100% = 20%. Therefore, his new savings rate is 30% + 20% = 50%. The amount he spends is now 50%, which means his new savings rate is 50%.

This means that the total distance between X and Y is 54 + 78 = 132 km.\n\nNow, we know that when Bob reverses his direction and goes back to Y, he travels 48 km more than Al did. This means that Al traveled d - 48 km when he went from X to Y. Similarly, Bob traveled d + 48 km when he went from Y to X.\n\nWe can set up an equation using these distances:\n\nd - 48 + d + 48 = 132\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2d = 132\n\nd = 66\n\nSo the distance between X and Y is 66 km.

We know that Al traveled 54 km in hmk, so we can set up a proportion:\n\n54 km / hmk = 66 km / x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 80 hmk\n\nSo the distance between X and Y is 80 hmk, which is equivalent to 144 km.

If the merchant chooses to sell the creature at a cost of $180 per unit, then their profit would be $180 - x. If they choose to raise the creature for another year and sell it at a cost of $40 per unit, then their profit would be $40 - x. \n\nWe want to find the average cost per year for the two options, so we can set up the equation: \n\n(180-x + 40-x)/2 = (140-2x)/2 = 70-x/2 \n\nThis expression represents the average cost per year for the two options. We want to find the percentage that this average cost is greater than the cost of raising the creature for one year, which is just x. \n\nSo we set up the inequality: \n\n70-x/2 > x \n\nMultiplying both sides by 2: \n\n140 - x > 2x \n\nAdding x to both sides: \n\n140 > 3x \n\nDividing both sides by 3: \n\nx < 46.67 \n\nSo the cost of raising the creature for one year must be less than $46.67. \n\nNow we can find the percentage that the average cost per year is greater than x: \n\n(70-x/2 - x)/x * 100% = (70-3x/2)/x * 100% \n\nSubstituting x = 46.67: \n\n(70-3(46.67)/2)/(46.67) * 100% = 12.5% \n\nSo the answer is (C), 12.5%.", "pred_strict": "C", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "C"}

Since each crate contains a certain number of pallets and each pallet contains p phones, we can set up the equation 1250 = p * number of pallets in one crate. Solving for p, we get p = 1250 / number of pallets in one crate. Since the total number of phones is 5000, we can also set up the equation 5000 = p * total number of pallets. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 5000 = (1250 / number of pallets in one crate) * total number of pallets. Simplifying, we get number of pallets in one crate = 5 * total number of pallets / number of pallets in one crate. Since the number of pallets in one crate must be a divisor of 5, the only possible values are 1 and 5. If there is only 1 pallet in each crate, then there are 5000 phones and 4000 pallets, which is impossible since each crate contains a certain number of pallets. Therefore, there are 5 pallets in each crate and 1000 phones in each pallet. Since there are 5000 phones in total, there must be 5 crates, and therefore a total of 5*5 = 25 pallets. Since each pallet contains p = 1000 phones, there are a total of 25*1000 = 25000 phones. The answer is (D).", "pred_strict": "D", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "D"}

If the distance between the entrance and exit of the tunnel is 1 kilometer (1000 meters), then it would take sound approximately 1000 / 343 = 2.91 seconds to travel through the tunnel. However, since the train is traveling at 120 kilometers per hour, or 33.33 meters per second, the distance between the entrance and exit of the tunnel is decreasing as the sound travels through it. This means that the sound has to travel a slightly longer distance than 1000 meters, but not by much. Using the formula distance = rate x time, we can solve for the time it takes for the sound to travel through the tunnel:\n\n1000 + 33.33t = 343t\n\n1000 = 309.67t\n\nt \u2248 3.23 seconds\n\nTherefore, it would take approximately 3.23 seconds for the sound to travel through the tunnel. However, since the question asks for the time it would take for the train to completely pass through the tunnel, we need to add the length of the train to this time. Let's assume that the length of the train is 100 meters. Then the time it would take for the train to completely pass through the tunnel is:\n\n100 / 33.33 \u2248 3 seconds\n\nAdding this to the time it takes for the sound to travel through the tunnel, we get:\n\n3.23 + 3 \u2248 6.23 seconds\n\nTherefore, the answer is closest to (E) 55 seconds.", "pred_strict": "E", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "D"}

We know that he wants to borrow $20,000, so P = 20000. We also know that he wants to pay back the loan in one year, so t = 1. \n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for r: r = I / Pt.

The total number of affected fields is x + 2.5x + 5x = 8.5x. Since this is equal to 50% of the total number of fields (250), we have 8.5x = 125, so x = 14.7. Since we can't have a fraction of a field, we round down to get x = 14. Therefore, the number of fields not affected by a worm is 250 - 2(14.7) = 220.6, which we round down to 220.

For the original coin, this is 2 mm x 15 mm x 2 mm = 60 mm^3. If the volume of the minimum and maximum of the alloy in the coin are equal, then the volume of the minimum must be half of the total volume, or 30 mm^3. \n\nTo find the weight of a coin with dimensions of 1 x 30 mm, we need to find its volume first. Its volume is 1 mm x 30 mm x 1 mm = 30 mm^3. Since the volume of the minimum in the alloy is 30 mm^3, this means that the coin is made entirely of the minimum. \n\nThe weight of the coin is equal to its volume multiplied by the weight per unit volume, which is given as 30 g / cm^3 or 0.03 g / mm^3.

Of those women, 75% disagreed with the color choice, which means 45 women disagreed. If 10 more women than men disagreed, then let's say x men disagreed. That means x + 10 women disagreed. So the total number of people who disagreed is x + (x + 10) + 45 = 2x + 55. We know that this is equal to 60% of the total number of people who took the survey, which is 60. So 2x + 55 = 0.6(100) = 60. Solving for x, we get x = 25. So there were 25 men and 60 women who took the survey, for a total of 85 people.

Then we know that Q takes half the time, so it takes \"x/2\" time to fill half the jar. We can set up the equation: \n\nx + x/2 = 10 \n\nSolving for x, we get x = 6.67 minutes. \n\nNow we can find the time it takes for Q to fill half the jar: \n\nx/2 = 3.33 minutes \n\nSo the total time it takes for both of them to fill the jar is: \n\n2(x + x/2) + 3.33 = 2(10) + 3.33 = 23.33 minutes \n\nTherefore, it would take them 23.33 minutes to fill the jar together.

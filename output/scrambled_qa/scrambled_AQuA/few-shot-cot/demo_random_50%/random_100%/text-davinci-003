Since the angle of the arc is between 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, the length of the arc is L = r(60\u00b0 - 45\u00b0) = 15r. The radius of the arc is the distance from the center of the arc to the end of the arc, which is the same as the distance from the center of the arc to the start of the arc. So the radius of the arc is 5(\u221a3 + 1). The total length of the arc is 15r, so the total length of the arc is 15(5(\u221a3 + 1)) = 75(\u221a3 + 1).

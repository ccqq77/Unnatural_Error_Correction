Since the angle of elevation changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 in 10 minutes, we can set up the following equations using the tangent function:\n\ntan(45\u00b0) = h/x and tan(60\u00b0) = h/(x - vt), where h is the height of the tower and vt is the distance the car travels in 10 minutes.\n\nSince tan(45\u00b0) = 1, we have h = x. Also, since tan(60\u00b0) = \u221a3, we have h = (x - vt)\u221a3.\n\nNow we can substitute h = x into the second equation: x = (x - vt)\u221a3.\n\nDivide both sides by x: 1 = (\u221a3 - v\u221a3t/x).\n\nNow we want to find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower, which is when x = vt. So we can substitute x = vt into the equation: 1 = (\u221a3 - v\u221a3t/vt).\n\nSimplify: 1 = (\u221a3 - \u221a3t)/t.\n\nNow solve for t: t = (\u221a3 - \u221a3t).\n\nAdd \u221a3t to both sides: t + \u221a3t = \u221a3.\n\nFactor out t: t(1 + \u221a3) = \u221a3.\n\nDivide both sides by (1 + \u221a3): t = \u221a3/(1 + \u221a3).\n\nNow multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate (1 - \u221a3) to rationalize the denominator: t = (\u221a3(1 - \u221a3))/((1 + \u221a3)(1 - \u221a3)).\n\nSimplify: t = (3 - 3\u221a3)/(1 - 3) = (3\u221a3 - 3)/2.\n\nSo the car will reach the base of the tower in (3\u221a3 - 3)/2 minutes.

We want this sum to be divisible by 10, so 5x + 20 = 10k for some integer k. This simplifies to x + 4 = 2k. Since x is odd, 2k must also be odd, which means k is odd. The smallest odd perfect square is 1, so let k = 1. Then x + 4 = 2, which is not possible since x is odd. The next odd perfect square is 9, so let k = 9.

Then 0.09x is the amount of vitamin E and 0.08x is the amount of vitamin A. Since we need at least the minimum daily requirement for both vitamins, we can set up the following inequality: 0.09x >= minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 0.08x >= minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. To find the smallest value of x that satisfies both inequalities, we can divide the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E by 0.09 and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A by 0.08, and then take the larger of the two results. Let's call the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E \"E\" and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A \"A\". Then x >= E/0.09 and x >= A/0.08. If we assume that E and A are both positive, then the larger of the two results will be the one with the smaller denominator, which is A/0.08. So x >= A/0.08. To find the smallest possible value of x, we can round up A/0.08 to the nearest whole number. If A/0.08 is already a whole number, then x = A/0.08. Otherwise, x = ceil(A/0.08), where ceil() is the ceiling function. In either case, the smallest possible value of x is 12.5. The answer is (C).", "pred_strict": "C", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "C"}

Since M > N, a > c. We are given that M - N + 396c = 990, so 90a - 90c + 9b + 396c = 990. This simplifies to 90a + 9b + 306c = 990. Dividing by 9, we get 10a + b + 34c = 110. \n\nNow we need to find how many values of M are more than 300. Since a > c, the smallest value of a is 4 (since if a = 3, then c = 2 and M would be less than 300). So we have 4 <= a <= 9. For each value of a, we can find the possible values of b and c that satisfy the equation 10a + b + 34c = 110. \n\nFor a = 4, we have 40 + b + 34c = 110, so b + 34c = 70.

Simplifying this equation, we get $99a-99c=495$, or $a-c=5$. \n\nNow we have a system of three equations with three variables: \n\\begin{align*} a+b+c&=17 \\\\ a^2+b^2+c^2&=109 \\\\ a-c&=5 \\end{align*}\n\nFrom the third equation, we get $a=c+5$.

This does not satisfy any of the equations. \n\nSince none of the answer choices satisfy all three equations, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work. \n\nIn the second equation, we should have $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$. We made a mistake in our substitution for $a$. We should have substituted $a=c+5$ into the second equation, which gives $(c+5)^2+b^2+c^2=109$.

We are given that (x^2 - y^2) = 256000 and x + y = 1000. We can rewrite the first equation as (x + y)(x - y) = 256000. Since x + y = 1000, we have 1000(x - y) = 256000. Dividing both sides by 1000, we get x - y = 256. Now we have a system of equations:\n\nx + y = 1000\nx - y = 256\n\nAdding the two equations, we get 2x = 1256, so x = 628.

If x and y are both integers, then [x] = x, [y] = y, and [x + y] = x + y. In this case, L(x,y) = x + y + x + y = 2x + 2y, and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] = 2x + 2y, so L(x,y) = R(x,y).\n\nIf x and/or y are not integers, let's consider the possible values of [x], [y], [x + y], [2x], and [2y]. Since x and y are positive real numbers, we know that [x] \u2264 x < [x] + 1, [y] \u2264 y < [y] + 1, and [x + y] \u2264 x + y < [x + y] + 1. Similarly, [2x] \u2264 2x < [2x] + 1 and [2y] \u2264 2y < [2y] + 1.\n\nNow let's consider the difference between L(x,y) and R(x,y): L(x,y) - R(x,y) = ([x] + [y] + [x + y]) - ([2x] + [2y]). Since [x] \u2264 x and [y] \u2264 y, we know that [x] + [y] \u2264 x + y. Therefore, [x + y] \u2264 [x] + [y] + 1. So, L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] \u2264 [x] + [y] + ([x] + [y] + 1) = 2([x] + [y]) + 1.\n\nOn the other hand, since [2x] \u2264 2x and [2y] \u2264 2y, we know that [2x] + [2y] \u2264 2(x + y). Therefore, R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] \u2264 2(x + y). Since x and y are positive real numbers, 2(x + y) < 2([x] + [y]) + 2. So, R(x,y) < 2([x] + [y]) + 2.\n\nComparing the upper bounds of L(x,y) and R(x,y), we have L(x,y) \u2264 2([x] + [y]) + 1 and R(x,y) < 2([x] + [y]) + 2. Therefore, L(x,y) < R(x,y) + 1. Since L(x,y) and R(x,y) are both integers, this means that either L(x,y) = R(x,y) or L(x,y) = R(x,y) - 1.\n\nWe already showed that L(x,y) = R(x,y) when x and y are both integers. Now let's consider the case when L(x,y) = R(x,y) - 1. In this case, L(x,y) + 1 = R(x,y), so ([x] + [y] + [x + y]) + 1 = [2x] + [2y]. Since [x] + [y] \u2264 x + y, we have [x + y] \u2264 2([x] + [y]) - 1. Therefore, L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] \u2264 3([x] + [y]) - 1.\n\nNow let's consider the difference between L(x,y) + 1 and R(x,y): (L(x,y) + 1) - R(x,y) = ([x] + [y] + [x + y] + 1) - ([2x] + [2y]). Since [x] + [y] \u2264 x + y, we know that [x] + [y] + 1 \u2264 x + y + 1. Therefore, [x + y] + 1 \u2264 [x] + [y] + 2. So, L(x,y) + 1 = [x] + [y] + [x + y] + 1 \u2264 3([x] + [y]).\n\nOn the other hand, since [2x] \u2264 2x and [2y] \u2264 2y, we know that [2x] + [2y] \u2264 2(x + y). Therefore, R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] \u2264 2(x + y). Since x and y are positive real numbers, 2(x + y) < 3([x] + [y]). So, R(x,y) < 3([x] + [y]).\n\nComparing the upper bounds of L(x,y) + 1 and R(x,y), we have L(x,y) + 1 \u2264 3([x] + [y]) and R(x,y) < 3([x] + [y]). Therefore, L(x,y) + 1 < R(x,y) + 1. Since L(x,y) + 1 and R(x,y) are both integers, this means that L(x,y) + 1 = R(x,y).\n\nSo, we have shown that for any two positive real numbers x and y, either L(x,y) = R(x,y) or L(x,y) + 1 = R(x,y). Therefore, the answer is (A) L(x,y) = R(x,y).", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "D"}

Then, the number of fields infested only by a worm is 2.5x. Since 50% of the fields were not infested by a virus, 125 fields were infested by a virus. So, the total number of fields infested by a worm is x + 2.5x = 3.5x. Since there are 250 fields in total, the number of fields not infested by a worm is 250 - 3.5x. The number of fields infested by a virus and a worm is x = 125 - 2.5x, so 3.5x = 125. Therefore, x = 125 / 3.5 = 35. The number of fields not infested by a worm is 250 - 3.5(35) = 250 - 122.5 = 127.5. Since there cannot be a fraction of a field, the answer is 125 fields.

Then we have:\n\ntan(45) = h/d\ntan(60) = (h+x)/d\n\nwhere x is the distance traveled by the car after the angle of elevation changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. Solving for h and x, we get:\n\nh = d*tan(45) = d\nh+x = d*tan(60) = d*\u221a3\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\nx = d*(\u221a3 - 1)\n\nWe know that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. Let v be the speed of the car in km/min. Then we have:\n\nx/v = 10\n\nSubstituting x, we get:\n\nd*(\u221a3 - 1)/v = 10\n\nSolving for d, we get:\n\nd = 10v/(\u221a3 - 1)\n\nTo find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower, we need to find the total distance traveled by the car. This is given by:\n\ndistance = d + x = d*(\u221a3 + 1)\n\nSubstituting for d and simplifying, we get:\n\ndistance = 10v(\u221a3 + 1)/(\u221a3 - 1)\n\nTo find the time, we divide the distance by the speed:\n\ntime = distance/v = 10(\u221a3 + 1)/(\u221a3 - 1)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ntime = 5(\u221a3 + 1)\n\nThe answer is (A).", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "A"}

Then we know that (h + l)/2 = x. We also know that the average score for the entire class is y, so the sum of all the scores is yz. We can write an equation for the sum of all the scores excluding the highest and lowest: (yz - h - l)/(z - 2) = average score excluding highest and lowest. Simplifying this equation gives us (yz - 2x)/(z - 2) = average score excluding highest and lowest. Adding in the highest and lowest scores gives us the average score for the entire class: (yz - 2x)/(z - 2) + (h + l)/2 = y.

Since the ant travels along the perimeter of the square, the distance traveled is 4 times the length of one side of the square. Let's assume the side length of the square is s. Then the total distance traveled is 4s.\n\nTo find the time taken, we need to divide the distance traveled by the speed. Let's assume the ant travels at an average speed of v. Then the time taken to travel one side of the square is s/v. Since the ant travels along all four sides of the square, the total time taken is 4s/v.\n\nTherefore, the average speed is:\n\naverage speed = total distance / total time\n= 4s / (4s/v)\n= v\n\nSo the average speed is simply the average of the speeds given, which is (200 + 400 + 600 + 800) / 4 = 500 km/hr.

Since each box contains a dozen toys, there are 2450/12 = 204.17 dozens of toys. Since we can only have whole numbers of dozens, we need to round up to 205. Therefore, we need at least 205 boxes to hold 29400 toys. Since each box holds a dozen toys, we need at least 205/12 = 17.08 boxes to hold one gross (12 dozen) of toys. Since we can only have whole numbers of boxes, we need to round up to 18. Therefore, we need at least 18 boxes to hold 144 dozen (1728) toys. Since 98 boxes are available, we can only fit 98/18 = 5 gross (60 dozen) of toys in the boxes. Therefore, we need at least 205 - 60 = 145 more boxes to hold the remaining toys. Since each box can only hold a dozen toys, we need at least 145/12 = 12.08 boxes to hold the remaining toys. Since we can only have whole numbers of boxes, we need to round up to 13. Therefore, we need at least 13 more boxes to hold the remaining toys. Therefore, the total number of boxes needed is 98 + 13 = 111.

So together, they complete 4/3 + 1 + 2/3 = 4/3 + 3/3 + 2/3 = 9/3 = 3 jobs in 8 days. This means they can complete the entire job in 8/3 days. After Mr. Brown leaves, Mr. Black and Mr. Blue work together for 6 days, completing 6/8 + 6/12 = 3/4 + 1/2 = 5/4 of the job. So they have 1 - 5/4 = 1/4 of the job left to complete. Let x be the number of days it takes Mr. Blue to complete this remaining 1/4 of the job. Then, in x days, Mr. Blue completes 1/12 of the job. So we have:\n\n4/3 * 8/3 + 1 * 6/8 + 1/4 * x = 1\n16/9 + 3/4 + 1/4 * x = 1\n1/4 * x = 1 - 16/9 - 3/4\n1/4 * x = 1/36\nx = 9\n\nSo it takes Mr. Blue 9 days to complete the remaining 1/4 of the job. Therefore, the total number of days it takes to complete the contract is 8 + 6 + 9 = 23 days.

It is made up of 5^3 = 125 smaller cubes. The surface area of each smaller cube is 6 square cm (since each face has an area of 1 square cm). So the total surface area of all the smaller cubes is 125 * 6 = 750 square cm. However, we need to subtract the surface area of the cubes that are inside the large cube and not visible from the outside. There are 3^3 = 27 such cubes (since the large cube has a height of 5 and the smaller cubes have a height of 1). The surface area of each of these cubes is 0 (since none of their faces are visible from the outside). So the total surface area that needs to be painted is 750 - 27 * 6 = 558 square cm. However, we need to divide this by 6 (since each face of the cube has to be painted). So the answer is 558 / 6 = 93. The number of smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 125 - 93 = 32.

We know that the greatest common factor of 350 and x is 11, so x must be a multiple of 11. We also know that the least common multiple of 350 and x is 7700, which can be factored into 11 * 2^2 * 5^2 * 7. Since x is a multiple of 11, it must have a factor of 11 in its prime factorization. We can also see that x must have at least one factor of 2, one factor of 5, and one factor of 7 in its prime factorization in order for the least common multiple to be 7700. So we can write x as 11 * 2^a * 5^b * 7^c, where a is at least 1, b is at least 1, and c is at least 1. \n\nWe know that the greatest common factor of 350 and x is 11, so we can write 350 as 11 * 2 * 5^2 and x as 11 * 2^a * 5^b * 7^c. The greatest common factor of 350 and x is the product of the common factors raised to the smallest power, so we have:\n\n11 * 2^min(1,a) * 5^min(2,b) = 11\n\nThis tells us that a must be 1 and b must be 2. We still don't know what c is, but we can use the fact that the least common multiple of 350 and x is 7700 to find it. We have:\n\n350 * x = 11 * 2 * 5^2 * 2^a * 5^b * 7^c = 11 * 2^2 * 5^2 * 7 * 11 * 2^a * 5^b * 7^c/11\n\nSince the least common multiple is 7700, we must have:\n\n11 * 2^2 * 5^2 * 7 * 11 * 2^a * 5^b * 7^c/11 = 7700\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2^a * 5^b * 7^c = 100\n\nWe know that a is 1 and b is 2, so we can substitute those values in and solve for c:\n\n2^1 * 5^2 * 7^c = 100\n\n7^c = 2\n\nc = 1\n\nSo x is equal to 11 * 2^1 * 5^2 * 7^1 = 1540.

Then we have $xy = 280$ (since the area of each triangle is 70) and the perimeter is $2x + 2y$. We want to find $2x + 2y$. We can rewrite this as $2(x+y)$. We know that $x+y$ is equal to half of the perimeter of the original rectangle, so $2(x+y)$ is equal to the perimeter of the original rectangle. Thus, we want to find $2(x+y)$. We can use the fact that $xy = 280$ to solve for $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = \\frac{280}{x}$. Substituting this into $2(x+y)$, we get $2x + 2y = 2x + 2\\cdot\\frac{280}{x}$.

We can set up two equations based on the given information:\n\n$540y + x = 1800$\n\n$620y + x = 2040$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\n$80y = 240$\n\n$y = 3$\n\nSubstituting this value of $y$ into either of the equations, we can solve for $x$:\n\n$540(3) + x = 1800$\n\n$x = 990$\n\nSo the bill for the first month was $990 + 540(3) = 2790$.\n\nFor the second month, we know that the fixed part of the bill is still $990$, but we need to find the new rate per call. We can set up another equation:\n\n$620y + 990 = 2040 + 500y$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$120y = 1050$\n\n$y = 8.75$\n\nSo the bill for the second month is $990 + 620(8.75) = 6165$.\n\nAdding the bills for the first two months, we get $2790 + 6165 = 8955$.

In those 3 hours, Train A travels 40 km/hr * 3 hrs = 120 km. Let's call the distance between Mumbai and Lucknow \"d\". When Train B leaves, the two trains are d - 120 km apart. The relative speed between the two trains is 72 km/hr + 40 km/hr = 112 km/hr. So it will take them (d - 120) / 112 hours to meet. \n\nTo find the time they meet, we need to add this time to the time Train B left, which is 2 pm.

We know that $a+b+c=17$ and $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$. We can use the first equation to solve for $c$ in terms of $a$ and $b$: $c=17-a-b$. Substituting this into the second equation and simplifying gives $2a^2+2b^2+2ab-2a-2b-90=0$. We can factor this as $(a+b-9)(2a+2b-10)=0$. Since $a$ and $b$ are digits, the only solution is $a+b=9$. Substituting this into the first equation gives $c=8$. So the number is $abc=890$. Subtracting 495 gives 395, which is the same as 593 in reverse order.

We know that for each dive, the total amount earned is 20 cents + 25 cents = 45 cents. So after n dives, the total amount earned is 45n cents. We also know that the total amount earned is $3.40, which is 340 cents. So:\n\n45n = 340\nn = 7.56\n\nSince we can't have a fractional number of dives, we need to round up to 8 dives. This means that the total number of coins used is 8 (since there is one dive for each coin). Let's call the minimum number of nickel coins needed to make up $3.40 with 8 coins x. This means that the number of brass coins is 8 - x. We can set up an equation:\n\n0.05x + 0.25(8-x) = 3.40\n0.05x + 2 - 0.25x = 3.40\n-0.20x = -1.40\nx = 7\n\nSo the minimum number of nickel coins needed is 7, which means the minimum number of brass coins is 1.

Then the length of the room is 3x. \n\nThe cost of papering the walls is equal to the perimeter of the room multiplied by the cost per meter, which is 2. \n\nSo, 2(5x + 3x) = 16x = 260, which means x = 16.25. \n\nThe area of the room is (2x)(3x) = 6x^2 = 6(16.25)^2 = 1575. \n\nSubtracting the area of the windows and doors (15 sq.m) gives us 1560 sq.m. \n\nTo find the height of the room, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid: \n\nA = (a + b)h/2 \n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the parallel sides and h is the height. \n\nIn this case, a = 2x, b = 3x, and A = 1560.

So the total number of pairs of students that could have selected the same pair of songs is 45 * 10 = 450. However, each pair of students is counted twice (once for each student), so we need to divide by 2 to get the total number of pairs of students: 450 / 2 = 225. Since there are 10 students in the survey, the total number of pairs of students is 10 choose 2 = 45. So the percentage of pairs of students that selected the same pair of songs is 225 / 45 = 5.

So we can set up the equation:\n\n0.56(total revenue) = x + 0.34(total revenue)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n0.22(total revenue) = x\n\nSo the revenue from biographies was 22% of the total revenue. This means that the answer is (B), 1.5.", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "B"}

Let's assume the merchant chooses to pay within 30 days and take the discount. They would pay 96% of the original price, which is $20,000 * 0.96 = $19,200. \n\nNow, let's assume the merchant borrows money to pay for the motor atob and wants to know the highest simple interest rate they can afford to pay back the loan and still make a profit from the discount. They would need to calculate the interest they would pay on the loan for 30 days and compare it to the $800 discount they received. \n\nThe interest they would pay on the loan can be calculated using the simple interest formula: \n\nI = P * r * t \n\nwhere I is the interest, P is the principal (the amount borrowed), r is the interest rate, and t is the time period (in years). Since we're calculating for 30 days, t = 30/365 (assuming a 365-day year). \n\nLet's assume the principal is $19,200 (the amount the merchant needs to borrow), and we'll solve for r: \n\nI = P * r * t \n\nr = I / (P * t) \n\nWe want to find the highest value of r that will still allow the merchant to make a profit from the discount. So we'll set the interest equal to the discount: \n\nI = $800 \n\nr = $800 / ($19,200 * (30/365)) \n\nr = 0.127, or 12.7% \n\nSo the highest simple interest rate the merchant can afford to pay back the loan and still make a profit from the discount is 12.7%.

From the given information, we can set up two equations:\n\n2a + 2b = 150\n2a + 3b + 3c = 300\n\nSimplifying the first equation, we get a + b = 75. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n2(75) + 3b + 3c = 300\n3b + 3c = 150\nb + c = 50\n\nSo the cost of one oat is 50 - b. We want to find the cost of 6 sodas and 7 oats, which would be:\n\n6a + 7(50 - b) = 6a + 350 - 7b\n\nSince the cost of the items doesn't change, this expression must be equal to 900 (since 900 cents is the sum of the costs of 6 sodas and 7 oats). So we have:\n\n6a + 350 - 7b = 900\n6a - 7b = 550\n\nWe can solve for a and b in terms of c by using the equations we derived earlier:\n\na + b = 75\nb + c = 50\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n\na - c = 25\n\nSo a = c + 25. Substituting this into the equation 6a - 7b = 550, we get:\n\n6(c + 25) - 7b = 550\n6c - 7b = 400\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\nb + c = 50\n6c - 7b = 400\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 7 and subtracting it from the second equation, we get:\n\n6c - 7b - 7c = 400 - 350\n-c - 7b = 50\nc + 7b = -50\n\nWe want to find the value of 6a + 7(50 - b), which is equal to:\n\n6(c + 25) + 7(50 - b)\n6c + 150 + 350 - 7b\n500 - c - 7b\n\nSubstituting in the value we found for c + 7b, we get:\n\n500 - (-50)\n550\n\nSo the answer is (D), 800 cents.", "pred_strict": "D", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "E"}

This means that the compound interest earned is Rs. 72 more than the simple interest earned. Let the principal be P and the rate of interest be r. Then, using the formula for simple interest, we have:\n\nSimple interest = P * r * 2\n\nUsing the formula for compound interest, we have:\n\nCompound interest = P * (1 + r)^2 - P\n\nThe difference between compound interest and simple interest is:\n\nCompound interest - Simple interest = P * (1 + r)^2 - P - P * r * 2 = Rs. 72\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nP * r^2 + 2P * r - 72 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nr = (-2P \u00b1 sqrt(4P^2 + 288P)) / 2P\n\nr = -P \u00b1 sqrt(P^2 + 72P) / P\n\nSince the rate of interest cannot be negative, we take the positive root:\n\nr = sqrt(P^2 + 72P) / P\n\nWe know that the principal is Rs. 5000 and the difference between compound interest and simple interest is Rs. 72. Substituting these values, we get:\n\n72 = 5000 * (sqrt(5000 + 72) / 5000)^2 - 5000 * r * 2\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nr = 6%\n\nTherefore, the rate of interest is 6%.

Then the unpainted sides have areas of $2lh + 2wh - lw$ and $2lh + 2wh - lh = lh + 2wh$. Since the unpainted sides have a combined area of 9 square feet, we have $lh + 3wh = 9$. The sum of the perimeters of the painted sides is $2l + 2w + 4h = 37$, which simplifies to $l + w + 2h = 18.5$. We want to find the area of the parking space, which is $lw$. We can use the fact that $(l+w)^2 = l^2 + 2lw + w^2$ to rewrite this as $lw = (l+w)^2 - l^2 - w^2$. Substituting $l+w = 18.5 - 2h$ and $lh = 9 - 3wh$, we get $lw = (18.5-2h)^2 - l^2 - w^2 - 9 + 3wh$. We can simplify this further using the fact that $l^2 + w^2 = (l+w)^2 - 2lw$, so $lw = (18.5-2h)^2 - (18.5-2h)lh + 9$. Substituting $lh = 9 - 3wh$ again, we get $lw = (18.5-2h)^2 - (18.5-2h)(9-3wh) + 9$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $lw = 81 - 37h + 4h^2$.

Let's start by choosing all 4 of the $2 candies, which gives us a total cost of $8.

This gives us a total of 7 candies chosen so far. We can continue adding 50 cent candies until we reach a total cost of more than $4. Adding one more 50 cent candy brings us to $4, so we cannot add any more candies. Therefore, we have chosen 7 candies in total, and we can choose 3 of them to be the 3 candy bars. The number of ways to choose 3 candies out of 7 is 35, but we need to multiply by the number of ways to choose the remaining 4 candies, which is 4*3*2 = 24.

Plugging this back into the equation for W, we get W = 4\u221a6. Finally, plugging L and W into the expression for the amount of fencing needed, we get 2(10\u221a6) + 4\u221a6 - 10 = 20\u221a6 + 4\u221a6 - 10 = 24\u221a6 - 10, which is closest to (B) 62.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "A"}

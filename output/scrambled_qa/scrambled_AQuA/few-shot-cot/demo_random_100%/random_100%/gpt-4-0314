So, the number of black marbles in the bag is 0.05(Q - 40). \n\nAfter the first draw, there were Q - 20 marbles in the bag, and all of them were put back in. So, the number of black marbles in the bag after the first draw is also 0.05(Q - 20). Since the same number of black marbles were in the bag after both draws, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.05(Q - 20) = 0.05(Q - 40)\n\nDividing both sides by 0.05, we get:\n\nQ - 20 = Q - 40\n\nAdding 20 to both sides, we get:\n\nQ = 400\n\nSo, the bag currently holds 400 marbles.

Let the first odd number be x, then the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers is x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 5x + 20. We want this sum to be divisible by 10, so 5x + 20 = 10y, where y is a perfect square. Simplifying, we get x = 2y - 4. Since x is a two-digit odd number, we can test the odd perfect squares to find a suitable value for y: 1, 9, 25, 49, etc. If y = 9, then x = 14, which is not a two-digit odd number. If y = 25, then x = 46, which is a two-digit odd number. So the 5 consecutive odd numbers are 46, 48, 50, 52, and 54.

Then 0.09x is the amount of vitamin E provided, and 0.08x is the amount of vitamin A provided. Since these amounts must be at least equal to the minimum daily requirements, we can set up the following inequalities:\n\n0.09x >= minimum daily requirement of vitamin E\n0.08x >= minimum daily requirement of vitamin A\n\nTo find the smallest value of x that satisfies both inequalities, we can divide the first inequality by 0.09 and the second inequality by 0.08:\n\nx >= minimum daily requirement of vitamin E / 0.09\nx >= minimum daily requirement of vitamin A / 0.08\n\nNow we can find the least common multiple of the denominators (0.09 and 0.08) to find the smallest value of x that satisfies both inequalities. The LCM of 9 and 8 is 72, so the smallest value of x is 72 / 9 = 8 for the first inequality and 72 / 8 = 9 for the second inequality. Since we need to satisfy both inequalities, we must choose the larger value of x, which is 9. Therefore, 9 grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.

We can rewrite the equation M - N + 396c = 990 as (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990. This simplifies to 99a - 99c + 396c = 990, which means 99(a - c) = 990 - 297c. So a - c = 10 - 3c. Since a and c are digits, we know that 1 \u2264 c \u2264 3. If c = 1, then a = 7 and M = 710 + 10b + 1 = 711 + 10b. If c = 2, then a = 4 and M = 410 + 10b + 2 = 412 + 10b.

Since the ages are in arithmetic progression, the sum of the ages can be represented as Sn = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term (7 years) and d is the common difference (3 months or 0.25 years). We are given that Sn = 250.\n\nSo, 250 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.25). Simplifying, we get 500 = n * (14 + 0.25n - 0.25). This simplifies to 0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0.\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the value of n: n = (-13.75 \u00b1 sqrt(13.75^2 - 4*0.25*(-500))) / (2*0.25).\n\nSolving for n, we get two possible values: n \u2248 20.08 and n \u2248 -24.58. Since the number of members must be a positive integer, we can conclude that there are 20 members in the club. The answer is (B).", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "C"}

Since C invested Rs.120,000, the ratio of his investment to his share of the profit is 120,000 / (2 / 5) = 300,000. Since A and B together invested Rs.100,000, their combined share of the profit is Rs.225,000. The ratio of their combined investment to their combined share of the profit is 100,000 / 225,000 = 4 / 9. Since B joined 2 months after A, the ratio of their investments is 40,000 / 60,000 = 2 / 3. Let x be the number of months after B joined that C joined. Then the ratio of A's investment to B's investment to C's investment is (2x + 4) / (3x) = 4 / 9. Solving for x, we get x = 4 months.

We are given that $a+b+c=17$ and $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$. We are also given that $(100a+10b+c)-495=(100c+10b+a) \\Rightarrow 99a-99c=495 \\Rightarrow a-c=5$. Now we have a system of three equations with three variables:\n\n\\begin{align*}\na+b+c&=17 \\\\\na^2+b^2+c^2&=109 \\\\\na-c&=5\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom the first and third equations, we get $b=12$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $a^2+c^2=1$. Since $a-c=5$, the only possible values for $(a,c)$ are $(3, -2)$ or $(-2, 3)$. However, since $a$ and $c$ are digits, we must have $(a,c)=(3, -2)$. Thus, the three-digit number is $100(3)+10(12)+(-2)=\\boxed{377}$.

We are given that (x^2 - y^2) = 256000 and x + y = 1000. We can rewrite the first equation as (x + y)(x - y) = 256000. Since x + y = 1000, we have 1000(x - y) = 256000. Dividing both sides by 1000, we get x - y = 256. Now we have a system of equations:\n\nx + y = 1000\nx - y = 256\n\nAdding the two equations, we get 2x = 1256, so x = 628.

The cost to cover the walls with paper is Rs.260, and the paper is 50 cm wide and costs Rs.2 per meter. The area of the paper needed is 15 sq.m for doors and windows. \n\nFirst, we need to find the total area of the paper needed to cover the walls. Since the paper is 50 cm wide, it covers an area of 0.5 m * 1 m = 0.5 sq.m per meter. The total area of the paper needed is 260 / 2 = 130 sq.m. \n\nNow, we need to find the area of the walls without doors and windows. The total area of the walls is 130 + 15 = 145 sq.m. Since the perimeter of the room is 5x meters, the area of the walls is 5x * 2x = 145. This simplifies to 10x^2 = 145, so x^2 = 14.5, and x = \u221a14.5 \u2248 3.8.\n\nThe height of the room is 2x = 2 * 3.8 \u2248 7.6 meters. However, this is not one of the answer choices.

In this case, S = 51, a_1 = -50, and we want to find k, which is the last term. Since the integers are consecutive, we can also find n by the formula n = k - a_1 + 1.\n\nPlugging in the given values, we have 51 = n(-50 + k)/2. Substituting n = k - a_1 + 1, we get 51 = (k - (-50) + 1)(-50 + k)/2. Simplifying, we get 102 = (k + 51)(k - 50). Factoring, we find that (k + 51)(k - 50) = 102.

When they meet for the first time, the total distance they traveled is d km. The ratio of their speeds is 54:78, which simplifies to 27:39. So the distance that Allen traveled when they first met is (27/66)d, and the distance that Bob traveled is (39/66)d.\n\nWhen they meet for the second time, Allen has traveled a total of d + 48 km, and Bob has traveled a total of d km. The ratio of their speeds is still 27:39. So the distance that Allen traveled after they first met is (27/66)(d + 48), and the distance that Bob traveled after they first met is (39/66)(d + 48).\n\nSince they both traveled the same distance after they first met, we can set up the equation (27/66)(d + 48) = (39/66)(d + 48). This simplifies to 27d + 27(48) = 39d. Solving for d, we get d = 72 km. The answer is (B).", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "E"}

If both x and y are integers, then [x] = x, [y] = y, [x+y] = x+y, [2x] = 2x, and [2y] = 2y. In this case, L(x,y) = x + y + (x+y) = 2x + 2y, and R(x,y) = 2x + 2y, so L(x,y) = R(x,y).\n\nIf either x or y is not an integer, let's consider the possible values of [x], [y], [x+y], [2x], and [2y]. Since [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x, we have [x] \u2264 x < [x] + 1. Similarly, [y] \u2264 y < [y] + 1, [x+y] \u2264 x+y < [x+y] + 1, [2x] \u2264 2x < [2x] + 2, and [2y] \u2264 2y < [2y] + 2.\n\nNow let's compare L(x,y) and R(x,y). We have L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] \u2264 x + y + (x+y) < [x] + 1 + [y] + 1 + [x+y] + 1 = R(x,y) + 3. On the other hand, we have R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] \u2264 2x + 2y < [2x] + 2 + [2y] + 2 = L(x,y) + 4. Therefore, L(x,y) < R(x,y) + 3 and R(x,y) < L(x,y) + 4.\n\nSince L(x,y) and R(x,y) are both integers, the only way for L(x,y) and R(x,y) to be equal is if they differ by a multiple of 3 and 4, which is 12. However, we have shown that L(x,y) < R(x,y) + 3 and R(x,y) < L(x,y) + 4, so their difference cannot be 12. Therefore, L(x,y) \u2260 R(x,y).\n\nThe answer is (B).", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "D"}

By the right-hand rule, the magnetic field lines will point into the page inside the arc. When the wire is in the uniform magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to rotate counterclockwise. \n\nThe angle between the initial and final positions of the wire is 60\u00b0 \u2013 45\u00b0 = 15\u00b0. If it takes 10 seconds for the wire to rotate this angle, then it will take 60/15 * 10 = 40 seconds to rotate a full 360\u00b0. \n\nDuring this time, the wire will have traveled a distance equal to the circumference of the circle with radius equal to the length of the wire. The length of the wire is the sum of the straight segment and the arc segment. Let x be the length of the straight segment. Then the length of the arc segment is (2\u03c0 \u2013 2)x, since the angle of the arc is 360\u00b0 \u2013 2(15\u00b0) = 330\u00b0. \n\nThe total length of the wire is x + (2\u03c0 \u2013 2)x = (2\u03c0 \u2013 1)x. This is also equal to the circumference of the circle, which is 2\u03c0r, where r is the radius of the circle. So (2\u03c0 \u2013 1)x = 2\u03c0r. \n\nSolving for x, we get x = 2r / (2\u03c0 \u2013 1). The distance traveled by the wire is equal to the length of the arc segment, which is (2\u03c0 \u2013 2)x. So the distance traveled is 2(2\u03c0 \u2013 2)r / (2\u03c0 \u2013 1). \n\nSubstituting the value of r in terms of x, we get r = x / (2sin(15\u00b0/2)). So the distance traveled is \n\n2(2\u03c0 \u2013 2)x / (2\u03c0 \u2013 1) = 4(\u03c0 \u2013 1)x / (2\u03c0 \u2013 1) \n\n= 4(\u03c0 \u2013 1)(2r / (2\u03c0 \u2013 1)) / (2\u03c0 \u2013 1) \n\n= 8r(\u03c0 \u2013 1) / (2\u03c0 \u2013 1)^2 \n\n= 8(2r / (2sin(15\u00b0/2)))(\u03c0 \u2013 1) / (2\u03c0 \u2013 1)^2 \n\n= 16sin(15\u00b0/2)(\u03c0 \u2013 1) / (2\u03c0 \u2013 1) \n\n= 16(\u221a(2 \u2013 \u221a3))(\u03c0 \u2013 1) / (2\u03c0 \u2013 1) \n\n\u2248 5.77 km \n\nThe answer is (E), None of these.", "pred_strict": "E", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "A"}

Simplifying this equation, we get:\n\nd / 75 + 100 = (d + 1000) / x\n\ndx + 7500 = 75d + 750x\n\n75x - dx = 7500\n\nx = 7500 / (75 - d)\n\nSubstituting this value of x in the equation above, we get:\n\nd / 75 + 100 = (d + 1000) / (7500 / (75 - d))\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nd = 1125 / (3d - 125)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3d - 125, we get:\n\nd(3d - 125) = 1125\n\n3d^2 - 125d - 1125 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get:\n\nd = 25 or d = -15\n\nSince distance cannot be negative, we have d = 25. Substituting this value of d in the equation for x, we get:\n\nx = 7500 / (75 - 25) = 150\n\nTherefore, the total journey duration is 150 hours. The total distance traveled is 1000 + 25 = 1025 miles. The average speed is:\n\naverage speed = total distance / total time = 1025 / 150 = 6.83 miles/hr\n\nThe total journey duration is 10 + 150 = 160 hours. The total journey distance is 1025 miles. Therefore, the total journey production is:\n\ntotal journey production = total journey distance / total journey duration = 1025 / 160 = 6.41 miles/hr\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth, we get 6.4 miles/hr.

If 2 non-defective messages were intercepted, then there were 78 non-defective messages that were received. If 72 non-defective messages were intercepted, then there were 6 non-defective messages that were not intercepted. So the total number of non-defective messages sent was 84 (78 intercepted + 6 not intercepted). Therefore, the total number of messages sent was 94 (10 defective + 84 non-defective). If each message had a corresponding deciphered message, then there were 188 total messages deciphered. Since 94 of these were defective, there were 94 deciphered messages that were defective and 94 deciphered messages that were non-defective. Therefore, there were 94 non-defective messages that were intercepted. So the total number of non-defective messages intercepted was 72 + 94 = 166. Therefore, the total number of non-defective messages sent was 166/0.78 = 213. Therefore, the total number of messages sent was 213 + 10 = 223. Therefore, the number of non-defective messages sent was 223 - 10 = 213. Therefore, the number of defective messages sent was 10. Therefore, the total number of messages deciphered was 223.

So the maximum number of students studying a subject is:\n\n- Math: 1/16x\n- Bio: 1/10x - 1/16x (since some students are already studying math)\n- History: 1/8x - 1/10x (since some students are already studying math or bio)\n\nTo find the minimum, we assume that all the students studying one subject are also studying the other subjects. So the minimum number of students studying a subject is:\n\n- Math: 1/16x - 1/10x - 1/8x (since all the math students are also studying bio and history)\n- Bio: 1/10x - 1/16x - 1/8x (since all the bio students are also studying math and history)\n- History: 1/8x - 1/10x - 1/16x (since all the history students are also studying math and bio)\n\nWe can simplify these expressions to get:\n\n- Maximum math: 1/16x\n- Maximum bio: 3/80x\n- Maximum history: 3/40x\n- Minimum math: x/128\n- Minimum bio: x/80\n- Minimum history: 5x/256\n\nTo get a 4-digit number, we need x to be at least 1250 (since 1/16 of 1250 is 78.125, which rounds up to 79). We can check that x=1250 satisfies all the conditions.\n\nPlugging in x=1250, we get:\n\n- Maximum math: 78\n- Maximum bio: 47\n- Maximum history: 37\n- Minimum math: 9.77 (rounded up to 10)\n- Minimum bio: 15\n- Minimum history: 24.41 (rounded down to 24)\n\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum number of students studying a subject is:\n\n- Math: 78 - 10 = 68\n- Bio: 47 - 15 = 32\n- History: 37 - 24 = 13\n\nSo the total difference is 68 + 32 + 13 = 113.

For the second number to be less than or equal to the square root of the first number, the second number can only be between 0 and the square root of the first number. So the probability of the second number being less than or equal to the square root of the first number is equal to the ratio of the area of the region where the second number can be (a right triangle with legs of length x and x^(1/2)) to the total area of the square (100 x 100), which is x^(3/2) / 10000. Therefore, the joint probability of (x,y) is (1/101) * (x^(3/2) / 10000).

Let's call this speed \"x\". So the distance covered in the forward journey is 6x.\n\nDuring the return journey, the jeep traveled for 4 hours at a speed of (x + 12) km/hr. So the distance covered in the return journey is 4(x + 12) = 4x + 48.\n\nThe total distance covered by the jeep is the sum of the distances covered in the forward and return journeys, which is 6x + 4x + 48 = 10x + 48.\n\nWe know that the distance covered in the return journey is twice as deep as the distance covered in the forward journey. So:\n\n4x + 48 = 2(6x)\n4x + 48 = 12x\n8x = 48\nx = 6\n\nSo the speed of the jeep during the forward journey was 6 km/hr. Therefore, the distance covered in the forward journey was 6 x 6 = 36 km.\n\nThe total distance covered by the jeep is 10x + 48 = 10(6) + 48 = 108 km.\n\nTherefore, the distance covered in the return journey was 108 - 36 = 72 km.\n\nThe average speed of the jeep for the entire journey is the total distance covered divided by the total time taken.

So the distance traveled is 200 km + 400 km + 600 km + 800 km = 2000 km. \n\nThe time taken for each leg of the journey is the distance traveled divided by the speed. So the time taken for the first leg is 200 km / 200 km/hr = 1 hr, the time taken for the second leg is 400 km / 400 km/hr = 1 hr, and so on. Therefore, the total time taken is 1 hr + 2 hr + 3 hr + 4 hr = 10 hr. \n\nSo the average speed of the plane is 2000 km / 10 hr = 200 km/hr. \n\nNow, to find the average speed of the plane during the descent, we need to find the time taken for the descent and the distance traveled during the descent. \n\nThe distance traveled during the descent is the length of one side of the square, which is 200 km. \n\nThe time taken for the descent is the difference between the time taken for the first three legs of the journey and the time taken for the last leg of the journey. The time taken for the first three legs is 1 hr + 2 hr + 3 hr = 6 hr. The time taken for the last leg is 4 hr. So the time taken for the descent is 6 hr - 4 hr = 2 hr. \n\nTherefore, the average speed of the plane during the descent is 200 km / 2 hr = 100 km/hr. \n\nThe answer is not given in the choices, so it is not possible to determine the correct answer.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "", "GT": "A"}

Then we have the system of equations:\n\n0.09x + 0.08y = 1 (since the total yield must be 100%)\nx/y = y/x (since the ratio of yields must be the same when the two plants are combined)\n\nSimplifying the second equation, we get x^2 = y^2, which means x = y or x = -y. Since we're looking for positive yields, we can ignore the second possibility.\n\nSubstituting x = y into the first equation, we get:\n\n0.09x + 0.08x = 1\n0.17x = 1\nx = 5.88\n\nSo the minimum yield of each plant is 5.88%. To achieve this yield, we need a total of 100/5.88 = 17 batches of each plant.

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of UR. Let x be the length of SR. Then TR = 17 - x. Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle SUR, we get:\n\nUR^2 = US^2 + SR^2\nUR^2 = 11^2 + x^2\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem on triangle UTR, we get:\n\nUR^2 = UT^2 + TR^2\nUR^2 = 11^2 + (17-x)^2\n\nSetting these two expressions for UR^2 equal to each other, we get:\n\n11^2 + x^2 = 11^2 + (17-x)^2\nx^2 = (17-x)^2\nx = 8.5\n\nSo SR = 8.5 and TR = 17 - 8.5 = 8.5.

Then the amount of salt in each part is x/6. When two parts are combined, the total amount of salt is 2(x/6) = x/3. This is 5/4 times the amount of salt in one roll, so the amount of salt in one roll is (1/5)(x/3) = x/15. When two rolls are combined, the total amount of salt is 2(x/15) = 2x/15. This is 7/5 times the amount of salt in one slice of bread, so the amount of salt in one slice of bread is (5/7)(2x/15) = 2x/21. Therefore, the ratio of the amount of salt in one roll to the amount of salt in one slice of bread is (x/15)/(2x/21) = 7/10. If the total number of rolls is n, then the total amount of salt in the rolls is nx/15. We want to find n such that the total amount of salt in the rolls is equal to the total amount of salt in n pairs of slices of bread, which is 2nx/21.

Let's call the distance from the starting point to the meeting point \"d\". \n\nBefore the ship accelerated, its speed was \"v\". So it took the ship d/v time to travel from the starting point to the meeting point. \n\nAfter the ship accelerated, its speed was \"v + 10\". We know that it took the ship 180 minutes (or 3 hours) to travel from the meeting point to the final destination. So we can set up another equation: \n\nd = (v + 10) x 3 \n\nNow we can solve for \"d\" by setting the two equations equal to each other: \n\nd/v = (v + 10) x 3 \n\nd = 3v(v + 10) \n\nWe want to find the distance from the meeting point to the final destination, which is d - 180v. Substituting the expression we just found for \"d\", we get: \n\nd - 180v = 3v(v + 10) - 180v \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\nd - 180v = 3v^2 + 30v - 180v \n\nd - 180v = 3v^2 - 150v \n\nd = 3v^2 - 30v \n\nNow we can use the fact that the ship traveled 180 miles from the meeting point to the final destination: \n\n3v^2 - 30v = 180 \n\nDividing both sides by 3: \n\nv^2 - 10v = 60 \n\nCompleting the square: \n\n(v - 5)^2 = 85 \n\nTaking the square root of both sides: \n\nv - 5 = sqrt(85) or v - 5 = -sqrt(85) \n\nv = 5 + sqrt(85) or v = 5 - sqrt(85) \n\nWe can discard the negative solution, since speed can't be negative. So the speed of the ship before it accelerated was 5 + sqrt(85) miles per hour. \n\nNow we can find the distance from the meeting point to the final destination: \n\nd = 3v^2 - 30v \n\nd = 3(5 + sqrt(85))^2 - 30(5 + sqrt(85)) \n\nd = 3(110 + 10sqrt(85)) - 150 - 30sqrt(85) \n\nd = 330 + 30sqrt(85) - 150 - 30sqrt(85) \n\nd = 180 \n\nSo the distance from the meeting point to the final destination is 180 miles.

Also, M - N = bac - cab = (b - c)a. So M - N + 396c = (b - c)a + 396c = 990. Since a, b, and c are all integers, we know that 990 - 396c is divisible by b - c. The only factors of 594 that are greater than c are 594 and 297. If b - c = 297, then M - N + 396c = 297a + 396c = 990. This simplifies to 99a + 132c = 330. Since a and c are integers, we know that a must be even and c must be odd. The only even multiple of 99 that is less than 330 is 198, which means a = 2 and c = 1. Plugging these values into M - N + 396c = 990 gives us M - N = 594, which means M = N + 594 = cab + 594. Since c is odd, we know that M is odd and N is even. The only possible values of b are 2, 4, 6, or 8. If b = 2, then M is less than 300. If b = 4, then M is less than 400. If b = 6, then M is less than 500. If b = 8, then M is less than 600.

The median of the field is the same as the median of the length and width, so it is halfway between the two. Let x be the length of the field. Then the width is also x, since the field is a square. The area of the field is x^2. Since the cow grazes half of the field, it grazes x^2 / 2 sq. ft. We want to find how many days it will take for the cow to graze the entire field, which has an area of x^2 sq. ft. If the cow grazes 140 sq. ft. in 14 days, then it grazes x^2 / 2 sq. ft. in (14 * x^2 / 2) / 140 = x^2 / 20 days. So we want to solve x^2 / 20 = 2x^2, which simplifies to x = 20.

Then, in the first month, 540 units were consumed, so the bill was 540x. We are given that this is equal to Rs. 1800, so x = 1800/540 = Rs. 3.33 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nIn the second month, 620 units were consumed, so the bill was 620x. We are given that this is equal to Rs. 2040, so x = 2040/620 = Rs. 3.29 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nIn the third month, some units were consumed, but we are not given how many. Let the number of units consumed be y. Then the bill for that month would be yx.\n\nThe total bill for the three months would be 540x + 620x + yx = (540 + 620 + y)x = (1160 + y)x.\n\nWe are given that this total bill is equal to some amount, which we don't know. Let's call that amount B. Then we have:\n\n(1160 + y)x = B\n\nSubstituting the values of x from the first two months, we get:\n\n(1160 + y)(3.29) = B\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n3801.4 + 3.29y = B\n\nFinally, we are given that the bill for the third month, when some units were consumed, was Rs. 1690. So we have:\n\nyx = 1690\n\nSubstituting the value of x from the first month, we get:\n\n540y(3.33) = 1690\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ny = 1.05\n\nNow we can substitute this value of y into the equation we derived earlier:\n\n3801.4 + 3.29(1.05) = B\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nB = Rs. 3840.95\n\nTherefore, the bill for the third month would be:\n\nyx = 1.05(3.33) = Rs. 3.50 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo the answer is (D) Rs. 1950.", "pred_strict": "D", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "B"}

To find the time it takes for them to return to the same starting point, we need to find the least common multiple of 13 and 7. The prime factorization of 13 is 13, and the prime factorization of 7 is 7. So the LCM is simply 13 * 7 = 91. This means that Ball A and Ball B will return to the same starting point after 91 units of distance. To find how long this will take, we need to divide 91 by their combined rate, which is 13 + 7 = 20 units per minute. 91 / 20 = 4 remainder 11, so it will take 4 full rotations plus an additional 11/20 of a rotation for them to return to the same starting point. To find how long this is in minutes, we can multiply the fraction by the time it takes for one full rotation, which is 60 / 13 minutes for Ball A and 60 / 7 minutes for Ball B. (11/20) * (60/13) is approximately 2.77 minutes for Ball A, and (11/20) * (60/7) is approximately 4.29 minutes for Ball B. Adding these times to the time it takes for 4 full rotations (which is 4 * 60 / 13 minutes for Ball A and 4 * 60 / 7 minutes for Ball B), we get a total time of approximately 4 hours and 31 minutes.

Let x be the number of units of work that can be completed in one hour by the average worker, and let y be the number of hours worked by the worker. Then the total amount of work completed is xy units. \n\nIf x works x hours per day, then the total amount of work completed is x^2 units per day. If y workers work for y hours per day, then the total amount of work completed is y^2 units per day. \n\nSince the amount of work completed is the same in both cases, we have x^2 = y^2.

If n workers work for y hours per day, then the total amount of work completed is nxy units per day. \n\nThe amount of work that can be completed by one worker in one day is xy = x(x) = x^2 units.

Therefore, the amount of work completed by n workers in y hours is n times the amount of work completed by one worker in one day. \n\nSo the amount of work that can be completed in one day by n workers working for y hours is n times the amount of work that can be completed in one day by one worker, which is x^2 units.

If 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y are mixed to form Z, then the total mass of Z is 100 grams. The ratio of X to Y in Z is 40:60, which simplifies to 4:6 or 2:3. Therefore, the ratio of Z to Y is (2+3):3 or 5:3. To find the ratio of Z to X, we can use the fact that the ratio of X to Y is 22:27. We can multiply both sides by a constant to get the ratio of Z to Y as 110:135. Then, we can simplify the ratio of Z to X by dividing both sides by 22, which gives us 5:6. Therefore, the ratio of Z to X in terms of zinc and copper is 5:6, or 5x:6x for some constant x. To find the actual ratio, we need to find the smallest integers that satisfy this ratio. We can start by trying x=1, which gives us 5:6. However, this does not add up to 100, so we need to scale up. Multiplying both sides by 10 gives us 50:60, which simplifies to 5:6. Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in the mixture is 5:6, and the answer is (B).", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "B"}

So the total distance between all the stops is:\n\n2x/5 + 3(x/5) + 4(x/5) + 3(x/5) + 2x/5 = 14x/5\n\nWe know that 3 times the distance between Hainrc and Panta is 3x, so:\n\n3x = 14x/5\n\nx = 15 km\n\nNow we can find the value of sub fare:\n\nsub fare = 490x = 490(15) = Rs. 7350\n\nBut we need to find the sub fare for 4 adults and 3 children, so we need to subtract the fare for 3 children:\n\nsub fare = 7350 - 3(70x) = 7350 - 3150 = Rs. 4200\n\nThe answer is (D).", "pred_strict": "D", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "E"}

Each employee contributes 1/x of the total productivity. So if there are n employees in a particular department, then that department contributes n/x of the total productivity. \n\nAccording to the problem, if each of the 6 employees in a particular department contributes an extra R. 10 of productivity, then the department's contribution increases from R. 6 to R. 6.24. This means that each employee in the department contributes R. 6 + R. 10/6 = R. 7/6 of productivity. \n\nSo the total productivity of the organization is x * (R. 6 + R. 10/6) = R. 7x/6. \n\nIf x employees each contribute 1/x of the total productivity, then the total productivity is just the sum of 1/x for all x employees. This is known as the harmonic series, and it is well-known that the sum of the first n terms of the harmonic series is approximately ln(n) + 0.5772 (this is known as the Euler-Mascheroni constant). \n\nSo we want to solve the equation R. 7x/6 = ln(x) + 0.5772 for x. This is not an easy equation to solve exactly, but we can use trial and error or a graphing calculator to find that x is approximately 300. \n\nTherefore, there are approximately 300 employees in the organization.

Then we can set up two equations based on the information given: \n\n0.01x + 0.02y = 3.40 (since she spent $3.40) \nx + y = minimum number of stamps she bought \n\nWe want to find the minimum number of stamps she could have bought, so we want to minimize x+y. \n\nTo do this, we can use the fact that she gets a discount of 5 cents for every pair of stamps she buys. So if she buys one one-cent stamp and one two-cent stamp, she gets a discount of 5 cents. This means that for every two stamps she buys, she gets a discount of 5 cents. \n\nSo if we can figure out how many pairs of stamps she bought, we can subtract that from the total number of stamps to get the minimum number of stamps she bought. \n\nTo find the number of pairs of stamps she bought, we can divide the total discount she got (20 cents) by the discount she gets for each pair of stamps (5 cents): \n\n20 cents / 5 cents per pair = 4 pairs \n\nSo she bought at least 4 pairs of stamps, which means she bought at least 8 stamps total. \n\nNow we can use the equation x + y = minimum number of stamps she bought to find the minimum value of x+y: \n\nx + y = 8 (since she bought at least 8 stamps) \n\nTo minimize x+y, we want to make x and y as close together as possible. The only way to do this with x+y=8 is to make x=4 and y=4. \n\nSo the minimum number of one-cent and two-cent stamps she could have bought is 4 of each. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 4.", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "C"}

We know that the first car travels at a speed of 55 mph and the second car travels at a speed of 52 mph. We want to find out how long it takes for the distance between them to be 15 miles.\n\nWe can start by setting up an equation using the formula:\n\ndistance = rate x time\n\nLet's let \"t\" be the time it takes for the distance between the cars to be 15 miles. Then we can write:\n\nd - 15 = 55t (since the first car is traveling faster and will cover more distance)\nd + 15 = 52t (since the second car is traveling slower and will cover less distance)\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (d and t). We can solve for one of the variables and then substitute that value into the other equation to solve for the other variable.\n\nLet's solve for \"d\" in the first equation:\n\nd = 55t + 15\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for \"d\" into the second equation:\n\n(55t + 15) + 15 = 52t\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n55t + 30 = 52t\n\nSubtracting 52t from both sides, we get:\n\n3t = 30\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\nt = 10\n\nSo it takes 10 hours for the distance between the cars to be 15 miles. But wait - the answer choices are all in hours and we're dealing with miles and mph! We need to convert the units so that we can compare our answer to the answer choices.\n\nWe know that distance = rate x time, so we can rearrange this formula to get:\n\ntime = distance / rate\n\nIf we want to find out how long it takes for the cars to be 15 miles apart, we can plug in the values we know:\n\ntime = 15 miles / 55 mph (for the first car)\ntime = 15 miles / 52 mph (for the second car)\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\ntime = 0.273 hours (for the first car)\ntime = 0.288 hours (for the second car)\n\nNow we can compare these times to the answer choices. We want to find the answer choice that is closest to the sum of these two times:\n\n0.273 + 0.288 = 0.561 hours\n\nThe answer choice that is closest to 0.561 hours is (A) 3 hours. This makes sense, since the two cars are traveling at relatively slow speeds and it would take a long time for them to cover a distance of 15 miles.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "B"}

The area of one face is just the side length squared. So if the side length is s, then the surface area is 6s^2. The volume of a cube is s^3. If we divide the surface area by the volume, we get (6s^2) / (s^3) = 6/s. So the ratio of surface area to volume is 6:s, which simplifies to 6:1. But the question asks for the ratio of the volume of the cube to the lateral surface area of the prism that will fit inside the cube. The lateral surface area of a prism is just the perimeter of the base times the height. Since the base of the prism is a square with side length s, the perimeter is 4s. The height of the prism is also s. So the lateral surface area is 4s^2. If we divide the volume of the cube by the lateral surface area of the prism, we get (s^3) / (4s^2) = s/4. So the ratio of volume to lateral surface area is 1:(4/s). But we know that 6:s is the ratio of surface area to volume, so we can substitute s = 6/v into the expression for the ratio of volume to lateral surface area: 1:(4/s) = 1:(4/(6/v)) = 1:(2/3v) = 3v:2.

So each circle's price is reduced by 27.75%, or $82.50. Therefore, the original price of each circle was $300 / 5 = $60, and the new price is $60 - $82.50 = -$22.50. Since a negative price doesn't make sense, we made an error in our calculations. Checking our work, we see that the area of a circle is proportional to the square of its diameter, not its radius. So the area is reduced by (0.85)^2 = 0.7225, or 27.75%, and the price of each circle is reduced by 27.75%, or $16.65.

Together, they cover 15 miles in one hour. So in 5 hours, they would cover 75 miles. Let's say that after x hours, person A has traveled the same distance as person B. This means that 9x = 6x + d, where d is the distance that person A needs to travel to catch up to person B. Solving for d, we get d = 3x. Using the formula distance = rate * time, we know that person A covers x * 9 miles in x hours, and person B covers x * 6 miles in x hours. Since they have covered the same distance, we can set these two expressions equal to each other: x * 9 = x * 6 + d. Substituting d = 3x, we get x * 9 = x * 6 + 3x, which simplifies to x = 3. So after 3 hours, person A has traveled 27 miles and person B has traveled 18 miles. At this point, person A is 9 miles ahead of person B. In the remaining 2 hours, person A will travel an additional 18 miles (since they travel 9 miles per hour), while person B will travel 12 miles (since they travel 6 miles per hour). So the distance between them will decrease by 6 miles per hour. In 3 hours, they will have covered a total distance of 45 miles, and person A will have traveled 27 + 18 = 45 miles.

When Alan starts from X and goes to Y, he covers a total of 54 km. When Bob starts from Y and goes backwards to X, he covers a total of 78 km. This means that the total distance between X and Y is 54 + 78 = 132 km.\n\nNow, let's say that Bob increases his speed by x km/hr and Alan decreases his speed by x km/hr. This means that Bob's new speed is (78/d) + x and Alan's new speed is (54/d) - x. We know that they meet at the midpoint, so the time it takes for each of them to get there is the same. Let's call this time \"t\".\n\nSo, we can set up the equation: (78/d + x)t = (54/d - x)t\n\nSimplifying, we get: 78/d + x = 54/d - x\n\nRearranging, we get: x = (54/d - 78/d)/2 = -12/d\n\nThis means that Bob's new speed is (78/d) - (12/d) = 66/d km/hr and Alan's new speed is (54/d) + (12/d) = 66/d km/hr.\n\nWe also know that Bob covers an extra 48 km by the time they meet, so we can set up another equation: (78/d) * t = (54/d) * t + 48\n\nSimplifying, we get: t = 48d/66\n\nNow we can plug this value of t into either of the equations we set up earlier to find x:\n\n78/d + x = (78/d) * (48d/66)\nx = -30/d\n\nNow we can use x to find d:\n\n78/d - 30/d = 54/d + 30/d\n48/d = 84\nd = 84 * (1/48) = 7/4 = 1.75\n\nSo the distance between X and Y is 1.75 * 100 = 175 km.

Then, the cost of raising it for four years would be 4x. \n\nIf the owner chooses to sell the creature after one year, they will need to sell it for at least $180 to break even. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nx + (profit percentage)(x) = 180\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(1 + profit percentage)x = 180\n\nSimilarly, if the owner chooses to keep the creature for four years, they will need to sell it for at least $160 (4 times $40) to break even. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n4x + (profit percentage)(4x) = 160\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(1 + 4*profit percentage)x = 160\n\nNow, we can solve for x by subtracting the two equations:\n\n3x + (4*profit percentage)x = 20\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx = 20 / (3 + 4*profit percentage)\n\nWe want to find the percentage increase in cost per year, which is:\n\n((cost for four years) - (cost for one year)) / (cost for one year)\n\nSubstituting in our expressions for these costs in terms of x, we get:\n\n(4x - x) / x = 3\n\nSo, the cost for four years is three times the cost for one year. Substituting in our expression for x, we get:\n\n4(20 / (3 + 4*profit percentage)) = 3(20 / (3 + profit percentage))\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n80 / (3 + 4*profit percentage) = 60 / (3 + profit percentage)\n\nCross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:\n\n240 + 320*profit percentage = 180 + 60*profit percentage\n\n260*profit percentage = -60\n\nprofit percentage = -0.23\n\nThis doesn't make sense as a percentage increase, so we made an error somewhere. Checking our work, we see that we made a mistake in setting up the equation for keeping the creature for four years. It should be:\n\n4x + (profit percentage)(4x) = 200\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(1 + profit percentage)x = 50\n\nNow, we can solve for x again:\n\nx = 50 / (1 + profit percentage)\n\nSubstituting this into our equation for the cost for four years, we get:\n\n4(50 / (1 + profit percentage)) = 3(50 / (1 + 4*profit percentage))\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n200 / (1 + profit percentage) = 150 / (1 + 4*profit percentage)\n\nCross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:\n\n200 + 800*profit percentage = 150 + 150*profit percentage\n\n650*profit percentage = -50\n\nprofit percentage = -0.077\n\nAgain, this doesn't make sense as a percentage increase. Checking our work again, we see that we made another mistake in setting up the equation for keeping the creature for four years. It should be:\n\n4x + (profit percentage)(4x) = 220\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(1 + profit percentage)x = 55\n\nNow, we can solve for x again:\n\nx = 55 / (1 + profit percentage)\n\nSubstituting this into our equation for the cost for four years, we get:\n\n4(55 / (1 + profit percentage)) = 3(55 / (1 + 4*profit percentage))\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n220 / (1 + profit percentage) = 165 / (1 + 4*profit percentage)\n\nCross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:\n\n220 + 880*profit percentage = 165 + 165*profit percentage\n\n715*profit percentage = -55\n\nprofit percentage = -0.077\n\nThis still doesn't make sense as a percentage increase, so we made another mistake somewhere. Checking our work again, we see that we made a mistake in our simplification of the equation for the cost for four years. It should be:\n\n4x + 4(profit percentage)x = 220\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(1 + profit percentage)x = 55\n\nNow, we can solve for x again:\n\nx = 55 / (1 + profit percentage)\n\nSubstituting this into our equation for the cost for four years, we get:\n\n4(55 / (1 + profit percentage)) = 3(55 / (1 + 4*profit percentage))\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n220 / (1 + profit percentage) = 165 / (1 + 4*profit percentage)\n\nCross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:\n\n220 + 880*profit percentage = 165 + 165*profit percentage\n\n715*profit percentage = -55\n\nprofit percentage = -0.077\n\nFinally, we have a valid answer. This means that the cost for one year is 55 dollars, and the cost for four years is 220 dollars. The percentage increase in cost per year is:\n\n((cost for four years) - (cost for one year)) / (cost for one year) = (220 - 55) / 55 = 3\n\nSo, the answer is 300%, which is equivalent to 16.7%.

So S = (1/2)(1+1) = 1. \n\nFor the second series (arithmetic progression), we need to find the last term. We know that the common difference is 340, and the last term is a + (n-1)d, where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms. We are given that the last term is 340 meters from the end of a 10-meter square table top. \n\nLet x be the distance from the end of the table top to the last term.

This means that the compound interest earned is Rs. 36 per year (since it is split evenly over the 2 years). So the rate of interest for the compound interest is 36/5000 = 0.0072 = 0.72%. The simple interest rate must be lower than this, since it earns less interest. Let's say the simple interest rate is x%. Then the interest earned after 2 years would be 5000 * (x/100) * 2 = 100x. We know that 100x - 5000 * 0.72% * 2 = 72, since the difference between the two types of interest is Rs. 72. Solving for x, we get x = 12%.

We know that S + W + B = 250. We also know that W = 2.5B, since the number of fields affected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number affected by both. \n\nIf 50% of the fields are not affected by a swarm, then the number of fields affected by a swarm is 0.5(250) = 125.

In this case, the quadratic equation is x^2 - 5x + k = 0, so a = 1, b = -5, and c = k. The discriminant is therefore (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k. To maximize this value, we want to minimize k. The maximum value of k would be when the quadratic equation has only one real root (i.e. the discriminant is 0), which occurs when (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 0. Solving for k, we get k = 25/4. To get the minimum value of k, we want to subtract a small positive number from 25/4. Let's subtract 1/16, which gives k = 99/16.

Then the total earnings for those 7 days would be 7x. Similarly, let the average wage for the last 7 days be $y and the total earnings for those 7 days be 7y. \n\nWe know that the total earnings for the 15 days is $90 per day * 15 days = $1350. So we can set up the equation: \n\n7x + 7y = $1350 \n\nWe also know that the total earnings for all 15 days is equal to the sum of the earnings for the first 7 days and the earnings for the last 7 days, plus the earnings for the 8th day (which we are trying to find). So we can set up another equation: \n\n7x + 7y + 1($z) = $15x + $15y \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n$z = $8x + $8y \n\nNow we can use the information given about the average wages for the first and last 7 days to set up two more equations: \n\nx = $87 \n\ny = $92 \n\nSubstituting these values into the first equation, we get: \n\n7($87) + 7($92) = $1350 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n$609 + $644 = $1350 \n\nSo 7x + 7y = $1253. \n\nSubstituting the values of x and y into the equation for $z, we get: \n\n$z = $8($87) + $8($92) \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n$z = $696 + $736 = $1432 \n\nFinally, we can find the average wage for the 8th day by dividing the total earnings for all 15 days by 15: \n\n($1350 + $1432) / 15 = $1782 / 15 = $118.80 \n\nSo the average wage for the 8th day was $118.80.

Let's say Jack's rate of work is J and Jill's rate of work is 0.05J (since Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate). Together, their rate of work is J + 0.05J = 1.05J.

So R.4578 is 0.84 standard deviations above the mean. We know that the mean is 50 and the standard deviation is unknown, so we can use the formula z = (x - mean) / standard deviation and solve for the standard deviation. 0.84 = (R.4578 - 50) / standard deviation. Solving for standard deviation, we get approximately 5.723. So the actual value of the 80th percentile is 0.84 standard deviations above the mean, which is 0.84 * 5.723 = 4.84.

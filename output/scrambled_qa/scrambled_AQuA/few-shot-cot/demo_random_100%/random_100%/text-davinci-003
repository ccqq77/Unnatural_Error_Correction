Since the angle of the arc is between 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, the angle in radians is between 0.785 and 1.047. The arc length is then equal to r(1.047 - 0.785) = r(0.262). The radius of the arc is equal to the length of the side of the triangle, which is 5(\u221a3 + 1). So the arc length is 5(\u221a3 + 1)(0.262) = 5(\u221a3 + 1).

To guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the revenue from sales must be at least $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800. The minimum selling price per component is $1,180,800 / (420 units/month * 12 months) = $235. However, since the selling price must be an integer, the minimum selling price is $236. The closest answer choice is (B)230, which would result in a yearly profit of $626,400 - ($236 - $110) * 420 * 12 = $600, which is less than the desired profit.

When folded along one set of sides, the new length is L/2 and the new width is W. The perimeter of this folded rectangle is 48 cm, so 2(L/2) + 2W = 48, which simplifies to L + 2W = 48.\n\nWhen folded along the other set of sides, the new length is L and the new width is W/2. The perimeter of this folded rectangle is 66 cm, so 2L + 2(W/2) = 66, which simplifies to 2L + W = 66.\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations:\n\nL + 2W = 48\n2L + W = 66\n\nWe can solve this system by multiplying the first equation by 2 and then subtracting the second equation:\n\n2(L + 2W) = 2(48)\n2L + 4W = 96\n2L + W = 66\n--------------\n3W = 30\n\nNow we can solve for W: W = 30/3 = 10. Plugging this value back into the first equation, we get L + 2(10) = 48, so L = 28.\n\nFinally, the area of the rectangle is L * W = 28 * 10 = 280.

Since the plane is flying along the four sides of a square, the total distance is 4s (where s is the side length of the square). \n\nTo find the total time, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. For each side, the time would be:\n\nt1 = s / 200\nt2 = s / 400\nt3 = s / 600\nt4 = s / 800\n\nThe total time would be the sum of these times: t_total = t1 + t2 + t3 + t4 = s(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800).\n\nNow we can find the average speed: average speed = 4s / (s(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)).\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get: average speed = 4 / (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800) = 384 km/hr.\n\nThe answer is (A) 384.", "pred_strict": "A", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "A"}

How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?\nChoices: (A)10,8 (B)9,8 (C)7,8 (D)5,6 (E)11,12\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the number of white sharpeners be x and the number of brown sharpeners be y. Then x + y = 18. Let the cost of each brown sharpener be b rupees. Then the cost of each white sharpener is (b+1) rupees. So, xb + y(b+1) = 100. \n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get x(18-x) + (18-x)(x+1) = 100. Simplifying, we get 18x - x^2 + 18x - x^2 = 100. Combining like terms, we get 2x^2 - 36x + 100 = 0. Dividing by 2, we get x^2 - 18x + 50 = 0. \n\nFactoring, we get (x-10)(x-8) = 0. So, x = 10 or x = 8. If x = 10, then y = 8. If x = 8, then y = 10.

So, the new contribution of each friend would be 96/x + 4. \n\nNow, we can set up the equation: (x-4)(96/x + 4) = 96. \n\nExpanding the equation, we get: 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x = 96x^2. \n\nSimplifying, we get: 4x^2 - 16x - 384 = 0. \n\nDividing by 4, we get: x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0. \n\nFactoring, we get: (x-12)(x+8) = 0. \n\nSince the number of friends cannot be negative, x = 12. \n\nSo, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 12 - 4 = 8.

The sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula Sn = n/2 * (a1 + an), where Sn is the sum of the series, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. In this case, Sn = 250, a1 = 7, and the common difference d = 3/12 = 0.25 years. \n\nWe can find the last term an using the formula an = a1 + (n-1)d. Since we don't know n, we can rewrite this formula as an = 7 + (n-1)0.25. \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for an back into the sum formula: 250 = n/2 * (7 + 7 + (n-1)0.25). Simplifying, we get 250 = n/2 * (14 + 0.25n - 0.25). \n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get 500 = n(14.25 - 0.25n). Expanding, we get 500 = 14.25n - 0.25n^2. Rearranging, we get a quadratic equation: 0.25n^2 - 14.25n + 500 = 0. \n\nSolving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, we get n = (14.25 \u00b1 \u221a(14.25^2 - 4*0.25*500))/(2*0.25). This simplifies to n \u2248 20.07 or n \u2248 24.93. Since n must be an integer, the number of members in the club is 20. The answer is (B).", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "C"}

Find the number.\nChoices: (A)368 (B)377 (C)288 (D)997 (E)112\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the three-digit number be $100a+10b+c$. We are given that $a+b+c=17$ and $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$. We are also given that $100a+10b+c-495=100c+10b+a \\Rightarrow 99a-99c=495 \\Rightarrow a-c=5$. Now we have a system of three equations with three variables:\n\n\\begin{align*} a+b+c&=17 \\\\ a^2+b^2+c^2&=109 \\\\ a-c&=5 \\end{align*}\n\nFrom the first and third equations, we get $b=12-a$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $a^2+(12-a)^2+c^2=109$. Since $a-c=5$, we can write $c=a-5$. Substituting this into the equation above, we get $a^2+(12-a)^2+(a-5)^2=109$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $3a^2-46a+184=0$. Factoring, we get $(a-4)(3a-46)=0$. Since $a$ must be a digit, we have $a=4$. Then $b=12-a=8$ and $c=a-5=4-5=-1$. Since $c$ must be a digit, there is no solution for the given problem. However, if we made an error in the problem statement and the sum of the squares of the digits is actually 149, then the solution would be $a=4$, $b=8$, and $c=5$, giving us the number $\\boxed{485}$.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "A"}

The height of the room is:\nChoices: (A)2.6m (B)3.9m (C)4m (D)4.2m (E)4.4m\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the height of the room be 2x meters and the semi-perimeter be 5x meters. The total area of the walls, including doors and windows, would be 2x * 5x = 10x^2 square meters. Since 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows, the area to be papered is 10x^2 - 15 sq.m.\n\nThe cost of papering the walls is Rs.260, and the paper is 50cm (0.5m) wide and costs Rs.2 per meter. So the total length of paper used is 260 / 2 = 130 meters. The area of the paper used is 130 * 0.5 = 65 sq.m.\n\nTherefore, 10x^2 - 15 = 65. Solving for x, we get x^2 = 8, and x = 2.

If the least integer is -50, then k =\nChoices: (A)40 (B)62 (C)82 (D)92 (E)102\nAnswer:", "output": "The sum of k consecutive integers can be represented as (-50) + (-49) + ... + (-50+k-1). The sum of these integers is 51. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: (first term + last term) * (number of terms) / 2. In this case, the first term is -50 and the last term is -50+k-1. So we have:\n\n(-50 + (-50+k-1)) * k / 2 = 51\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(-100+k) * k / 2 = 51\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n(-100+k) * k = 102\n\nExpanding, we get:\n\nk^2 - 100k + 102 = 0\n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n(k-51)(k+2) = 0\n\nThe possible values for k are 51 and -2. Since k must be positive, the answer is k = 51. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We made an error in our calculations. The correct formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is (first term + last term) * (number of terms) / 2. In this case, the first term is -50 and the last term is -50+k-1. So we have:\n\n(-50 + (-50+k-1)) * k / 2 = 51\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(-100+k) * k / 2 = 51\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n(-100+k) * k = 102\n\nExpanding, we get:\n\nk^2 - 100k + 102 = 0\n\nThis equation does not factor easily, so we can use the quadratic formula to find the value of k:\n\nk = (100 \u00b1 \u221a(100^2 - 4(102))) / 2\n\nk = (100 \u00b1 \u221a9984) / 2\n\nk = (100 \u00b1 62) / 2\n\nThe possible values for k are 81 and 19. Since the least integer is -50, the sequence must include more than 19 integers. Therefore, the answer is k = 81, which is not one of the answer choices.

They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.\nHow many times did the coin landed on Heads ?\nChoices: (A)10 (B)23 (C)16 (D)18 (E)12\nAnswer:", "output": "Let H be the number of times the coin landed on heads, and T be the number of times it landed on tails. Since the coin was flipped 20 times, H + T = 20. Since neither person won or lost any money, the amount Christopher gave to Jonathan ($2 per head) must equal the amount Jonathan gave to Christopher ($3 per tail), so 2H = 3T. \n\nNow we can solve the system of equations:\n\nH + T = 20\n2H = 3T\n\nWe can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get:\n\n2(20 - T) = 3T\n40 - 2T = 3T\n40 = 5T\nT = 8\n\nNow we can find H:\n\nH + 8 = 20\nH = 12\n\nSo the coin landed on heads 12 times.

At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.\nChoices: (A)144km (B)72 km (C)126km (D)84 km (E)48km\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the distance between X and Y be D km. \n\nWhen they meet for the first time, the sum of the distances covered by Allen and Bob is equal to D. Let the distance covered by Allen be A km and the distance covered by Bob be B km. So, A + B = D. \n\nWhen they meet for the second time, Allen has covered A + 48 km and Bob has covered B + 48 km. The sum of the distances covered by Allen and Bob is now equal to 2D. So, (A + 48) + (B + 48) = 2D. \n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get (A + B) + 96 = 2D. Since A + B = D, we have D + 96 = 2D. This means that D = 96 km. \n\nNow, we can use the ratio of their speeds to find the distance covered by each of them when they meet for the first time. The ratio of their speeds is 54:78, which simplifies to 9:13. \n\nLet the distance covered by Allen be 9x km and the distance covered by Bob be 13x km. So, 9x + 13x = 96. This gives 22x = 96, which means x = 4.4. \n\nTherefore, the distance covered by Allen is 9x = 9(4.4) = 39.6 km, and the distance covered by Bob is 13x = 13(4.4) = 57.2 km. \n\nThe distance between X and Y is equal to the sum of the distances covered by Allen and Bob, which is 39.6 + 57.2 = 96.8 km. Since the distance must be a whole number, we can round this up to 97 km. However, this is not one of the given choices. \n\nThe closest answer choice to 97 km is (A) 144 km, but this is significantly larger than our calculated value.

Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, the volume of aluminum in the coin is 225\u03c0/2 mm^3. Let the weight of aluminum be A grams and the weight of silver be S grams. Then A + S = 30 grams and A/S = 1/2 (since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum). Solving this system of equations, we find A = 10 grams and S = 20 grams.\n\nNow, find the volume of the new coin: V = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(15^2)(1) = 225\u03c0 mm^3. Since the new coin is made of pure aluminum, its weight will be proportional to the weight of aluminum in the original coin. The proportionality constant is the ratio of the volumes of the new and original coins: 225\u03c0 / (225\u03c0/2) = 2. Therefore, the weight of the new coin is 2 * 10 grams = 20 grams.

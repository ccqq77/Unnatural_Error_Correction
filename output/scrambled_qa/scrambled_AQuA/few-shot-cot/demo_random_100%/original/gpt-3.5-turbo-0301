The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\nChoices: (A)5(\u221a3 + 1) (B)6(\u221a3 + \u221a2) (C)7(\u221a3 \u2013 1) (D)8(\u221a3 \u2013 2) (E)None of these\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the height of the tower be h and the distance between the car and the base of the tower be x. Then we have:\n\ntan(45\u00b0) = h/x\ntan(60\u00b0) = h/(x + vt)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the car and t is the additional time it takes to reach the base of the tower. We can simplify the second equation using the identity tan(60\u00b0) = \u221a3:\n\n\u221a3 = h/(x + vt)\n\nSolving for h in the first equation and substituting into the second equation, we get:\n\n\u221a3 = x/(x/v + t) + h/(x/v + t)\n\u221a3(x/v + t) = x + h\nh = \u221a3(x/v + t) - x\n\nWe want to solve for t, so we need another equation. We can use the fact that it takes 10 minutes (1/6 hour) for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0:\n\ntan(60\u00b0) - tan(45\u00b0) = h/(x + vt) - h/x\n\u221a3 - 1 = h/(x + vt) - h/x\n\u221a3 - 1 = (\u221a3(x/v + t) - x)/(x + vt)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (x + vt) and simplifying, we get:\n\n(x + vt)(\u221a3 - 1) = \u221a3(x/v + t) - x\n\u221a3x + (v + v\u221a3)t = \u221a3x + vt\nt = (\u221a3 - 1)/(v\u221a3 - v)\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nt = (\u221a3 - 1)/(v\u221a3 - v) = 6(\u221a3 + \u221a2)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "A"}

This means that the total time to travel n steps is 20 minutes. \n\nFrom the second scenario, we know that walking 10 steps takes 20 minutes, so the time it takes to travel (n-10) steps in the elevator is also 20 minutes. This means that the total time to travel n steps is 40 minutes. \n\nSetting these two expressions for the total time equal to each other, we get: \n\n20 + (n-20)/x = 40 + (n-10)/x \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n(n-10)/x = 20 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx = (n-10)/20 \n\nWe don't know the value of n, but we do know that the answer choices are all in steps/minute. So let's rewrite our equation in terms of steps/minute: \n\nx = n/20 - 1/2 \n\nThis tells us that the speed of the elevator is proportional to the total number of steps in the staircase. Since we don't know the value of n, we can't determine the exact speed of the elevator. However, we can see that the answer choices are all integers, so we can try plugging in different values of n until we get an integer answer. \n\nFor example, if n = 40, then x = 1 step/minute. If n = 60, then x = 2 steps/minute. If n = 70, then x = 3 steps/minute. None of these match the answer choices, so we can try higher values of n. \n\nIf n = 90, then x = 4 steps/minute, which matches answer choice (D).

If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?\nChoices: (A)(zy \u2013 2x)/z (B)(zy \u2013 2)/z (C)(zx \u2013 y)/(z \u2013 2) (D)(zy \u2013 2x)/(z -2) (E)(zy \u2013 x)/(z + 2)\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the highest score be H and the lowest score be L. We know that (H + L)/2 = x, so H + L = 2x. We also know that the average score for the entire class is y, so the sum of all the scores is yz. \n\nTo find the sum of all the scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we can subtract H and L from the sum of all the scores. So the sum of the remaining scores is yz - H - L. \n\nWe can express H and L in terms of x using the equation H + L = 2x. We know that there are z students in the class, so the sum of all the scores is the sum of the remaining scores plus H plus L: \n\nyz = yz - H - L + H + L \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\nyz = yz + 2x \n\n2x = 0 \n\nThis is a contradiction, so our initial assumption that the highest and lowest scorers are excluded must be incorrect. Therefore, the answer is (none of the above).", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "", "GT": "D"}

So the total profit he makes is 0.3125x times the number of bags he sells. We know that he makes $3,000 in profit, so 0.3125x times the number of bags he sells equals 3,000.

During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?\nChoices: (A)15 (B)16 (C)17 (D)18 (E)19\nAnswer:", "output": "Let x be the number of toys made by Alex and y be the number of toys made by Jacob. We know that x + y = 35 and 7x + 9y = total number of hours worked by both of them. Since both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that their total number of hours worked is approximately the same. So we can set 7x + 9y = k(35), where k is some constant. Simplifying, we get 7x + 9y = 35k. We know that x + y = 35, so we can solve for y in terms of x: y = 35 - x. Substituting into the equation 7x + 9y = 35k, we get 7x + 9(35 - x) = 35k. Simplifying, we get 2x = 35k - 315, which means x = (35k - 315) / 2. Since x is the number of toys made by Alex, it must be an integer. This means that 35k - 315 must be even. The only value of k that works is k = 9, which gives x = 12 and y = 23.

The number of cubes on the surface is (5^2 - 3^2) * 6 = 96. However, the cubes on the corners are counted twice, so we need to subtract those out. There are 8 corners, and each corner is made up of 3 cubes, so we subtract 8*3 = 24. Therefore, the total number of unpainted cubes is 343 - 96 + 24 = 271. However, each unpainted cube has 3 faces that are unpainted, so we need to multiply by 3 to get the total number of unpainted faces, which is 813. Finally, we subtract this from the total number of faces in the smaller cubes, which is 5^3 * 6 = 750, to get the answer of 750 - 813 = -63. However, since we can't have a negative number of unpainted faces, the answer is 0. The answer is (none of the above).", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "", "GT": "A"}

Also, M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99(a - c). So we have 99(a - c) + 396c = 990, which simplifies to 11(a - c) + 4c = 30. Since a > c, we know that a - c is at least 1, so the possible values of a - c are 1, 2, or 3. \n\nIf a - c = 1, then 11 + 4c = 30, which means c = 5. This gives us the number 195, which is the only three-digit number that works in this case. \n\nIf a - c = 2, then 22 + 4c = 30, which means c = 2.

So, A = \u03c0(14/2)^2 = 153.94 sq.ft. \n\nIf the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then it will take approximately 15.39 days to graze 153.94 sq.ft. However, this assumes that the cow grazes in a straight line and doesn't overlap its grazing areas. In reality, the cow will likely graze in a circular pattern, which means it will take longer to graze the entire field. \n\nAssuming the cow grazes in a circular pattern, it will cover an area of 10 sq.ft. per day in the shape of a sector of a circle. The angle of the sector can be calculated using the formula \u03b8 = (A/r^2) * (180/\u03c0), where A is the area of the sector (10 sq.ft.), r is the length of the rope (14 ft), and \u03b8 is the angle in degrees. \n\n\u03b8 = (10/14^2) * (180/\u03c0) \u2248 0.91 degrees \n\nSo, the cow will graze an area of 0.91 degrees per day. To cover the entire field, it will need to graze an area of 360 degrees. \n\nTime taken = (360/0.91) days \u2248 395.60 days \n\nHowever, this assumes that the cow grazes continuously without any breaks. In reality, the cow will need to rest and sleep, so it will take longer than 395.60 days. \n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is (E) 91 days.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "B"}

Karan wants to make a 20% profit, so he wants to sell the sewing machine for 1.2x. He also wants to offer a 20% discount, which means he will sell the sewing machine for 0.8(1.2x) = 0.96x. Karan's profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is 0.96x - 1200. Karan wants this profit to be 20% of the cost price, which is 0.2(1200) = 240. So we have the equation:\n\n0.96x - 1200 = 240\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n0.96x = 1440\n\nx = 1500\n\nSo Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1500/- to make a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount.

At what time will the two trains meet each other?\nChoices: (A)12 am on the next day (B)5 am on the next day (C)5 pm on the next day (D)2 pm on the next day (E)None of these\nAnswer:", "output": "Train A has a head start of 3 hours, so it travels 3 hours * 40 kmph = 120 km before Train B starts. Let's call the distance that Train B travels before they meet \"x\". \n\nWhen Train B starts, the distance between the two trains is 120 km. They are both traveling towards each other, so their combined speed is 40 kmph + 72 kmph = 112 kmph. \n\nUsing the formula distance = rate * time, we can set up the equation: \n\n120 km + x = 112 kmph * t \n\nwhere \"t\" is the time (in hours) it takes for the two trains to meet. \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\nx = 112t - 120 \n\nWe know that Train B starts at 2 pm, which is 3 hours after Train A starts. So the time they meet is also 3 hours after Train B starts, or 5 pm. \n\nPlugging in t = 3 into our equation, we get: \n\nx = 112(3) - 120 = 216 km \n\nSo the two trains meet 216 km from Mumbai Central, which is 120 km from where Train A started. \n\nSince Train A travels at a speed of 40 kmph, it takes 120 km / 40 kmph = 3 hours to reach the meeting point. \n\nTherefore, the two trains meet at 5 pm + 3 hours = 8 pm.

If Mark gets half of John's money, then Mark will have (x/2) + 75. If John gets one third of Mark's money, then John will have ((x/2) - 75) / 3. We can set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for x:\n\n(x/2) + 75 = ((x/2) - 75) / 3\nMultiplying both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:\n3x + 450 = x - 150\n2x = -600\nx = -300\n\nThis doesn't make sense as an answer, since John's amount of money cannot be negative. However, we can see that if we reverse the roles and assume that John gets half of Mark's money and Mark gets one third of John's money, we get a valid solution:\n\nIf John gets half of Mark's money, then John will have (x/2) - 75. If Mark gets one third of John's money, then Mark will have ((x/2) + 75) / 3. Setting these two expressions equal to each other and solving for x:\n\n(x/2) - 75 = ((x/2) + 75) / 3\nMultiplying both sides by 6:\n3x - 450 = x + 150\n2x = 600\nx = 300\n\nSo John had Rs.300.

We know that each copper coin is worth 20 cents and each brass coin is worth 25 cents, so we can set up the equation:\n\n20x + 25y = 340\n\nWe also know that the total number of coins brought up is x + y. We want to find the minimum number of copper coins, so we want to minimize x. We can use the equation above to solve for y in terms of x:\n\n25y = 340 - 20x\ny = (340 - 20x) / 25\ny = 13.6 - 0.8x\n\nSince y has to be a whole number (you can't bring up a fraction of a coin), we know that x has to be a multiple of 5. We also know that x + y has to be an integer, so we can try different values of x until we find one that works:\n\nIf x = 5, then y = 9. This gives us a total of 14 coins, which works.\nIf x = 10, then y = 6. This gives us a total of 16 coins, which works.\nIf x = 15, then y = 3. This gives us a total of 18 coins, which works.\nIf x = 20, then y = 0. This gives us a total of 20 coins, which works.\n\nWe can stop here, since any higher value of x would give us fewer than 20 coins.

This means that if the merchant pays within 30 days, they only have to pay $20,000 * 0.96 = $19,200. If they don't pay within 30 days, they have to pay the full $20,000. \n\nLet x be the interest rate, and let t be the time in days that the merchant borrows the money for. Then, we can set up the equation:\n\n$19,200 = $20,000 * (1 + xt/365)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n0.96 = 1 + xt/365\nxt/365 = -0.04\nt = -9.125x\n\nSince t has to be positive, we know that x has to be negative. Also, since we want the highest interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money, we want the absolute value of x to be as small as possible. \n\nThe highest interest rate is when x is the smallest negative number that still satisfies the equation. Plugging in x = -27.67, we get:\n\nt = -9.125(-27.67) = 252.67\n\nThis means that the merchant can borrow money at an interest rate of 27.67% for 252.67 days and still be able to afford the discount.

For L(x,y), the values range from the sum of the three greatest integers less than or equal to x, y, and x+y (when x and y are integers) to the sum of the three greatest integers less than or equal to x+1, y+1, and x+y+1 (when x and y are just below integers). For R(x,y), the values range from the sum of the two greatest integers less than or equal to 2x and 2y (when 2x and 2y are integers) to the sum of the two greatest integers less than or equal to 2x+1 and 2y+1 (when 2x and 2y are just below integers).\n\nNow, suppose L(x,y) = R(x,y). Then we must have [x] + [y] + [x+y] = [2x] + [2y]. Since the left side is an integer, the right side must also be an integer. This means that 2x and 2y are either both integers or both just below integers. In the first case, we have [2x] = 2[x] and [2y] = 2[y], so the equation becomes [x] + [y] + [x+y] = 2[x] + 2[y], or equivalently [x+y] = [x] + [y]. But this is impossible, since [x+y] can be at most [x]+[y]+1 (when x and y are just below integers), and [x]+[y] can be at most 2[x]+1 (when x is just below an integer). In the second case, we have [2x] = 2[x]-1 and [2y] = 2[y]-1, so the equation becomes [x] + [y] + [x+y] = 2[x] + 2[y] - 2, or equivalently [x+y] = [x] + [y] + 1. But this is also impossible, since [x+y] can be at most [x]+[y]+1 (when x and y are just below integers), and [x]+[y]+1 can be at least 2[x]+1 (when x is just below an integer).\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) = R(x,y).

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?\nChoices: (A)36 grams (B)40 grams (C)42 grams (D)48 grams (E)50 grams\nAnswer:", "output": "The volume of the coin is pi * (15/2)^2 * 2 = 706.86 mm^3. Let x be the volume of aluminum in the alloy, so the volume of silver is also x. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of the silver in the coin is 2x and the weight of the aluminum is (30 - 2x). \n\nWe can set up a proportion to find x: \n\nx / (30 - 2x) = 1/3 \n\nSolving for x, we get x = 10 mm^3. So the coin contains 10 mm^3 of aluminum and 10 mm^3 of silver. \n\nNow we can find the weight of a pure aluminum coin with the same volume as the aluminum in the alloy coin: \n\n(10 mm^3) * (1 g/mm^3) = 10 grams \n\nSo the weight of a pure aluminum coin measuring 1 x 30 mm would be 10 grams.

Then, 40% of x is orange juice, which is 0.4x gallons. Since we want the orange juice to be 60% of the soft drink, we need to add y gallons of pure orange juice. So, the total amount of orange juice in the new mixture would be 0.4x + y, and the total amount of soft drink would be x + y. We want the ratio of orange juice to soft drink to be 60%, which means:\n\n(0.4x + y) / (x + y) = 0.6\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n0.4x + y = 0.6(x + y)\n0.4x + y = 0.6x + 0.6y\n0.2x = 0.4y\ny = 0.5x\n\nSo, we need to add 0.5x gallons of pure orange juice to the soft drink to make it 60% orange juice.

We know that $x+y+9=37$, so $x+y=28$. The area of the rectangle is $xy$, so we want to find $xy$. We can use the fact that $(x+y)^2=x^2+2xy+y^2$ to find $xy$. We know that $(x+y)^2=28^2=784$ and $x^2+y^2=(x+y)^2-2xy=784-2xy$. Adding $2xy$ to both sides gives $2xy+x^2+y^2=784$, which means $2xy=784-(x^2+y^2)$. We don't know $x$ and $y$ individually, but we do know that $x+y=28$ and $x^2+y^2=(x+y)^2-2xy=784-2xy$, so we can substitute to get $2xy=784-(28^2-2xy)$, which simplifies to $4xy=784-28^2=80$.

If he finishes two-thirds of the work, then he still has one-third of the work left to do. Let's call the total amount of work W. Then Jack has done 2/3W and there is 1/3W left to do. \n\nJill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, so she can clean 1/20 of what Jack can do in 1 hour. Let's call the amount of time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work x. Then we can set up the equation: \n\n(1/20)x = 1/3W \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx = (1/20) * (3/W) \n\nx = 3/20W \n\nWe know that Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so he can clean 1/12 of the yacht in 1 hour. Therefore, the total amount of work W is: \n\nW = (1/12) * 1 \n\nW = 1/12 \n\nPlugging this into our equation for x, we get: \n\nx = 3/20 * (1/12) \n\nx = 1/80 \n\nSo it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. The answer is not listed, so we can assume it is not a valid answer choice. However, we can check our work by verifying that Jack can clean two-thirds of the yacht in 8 hours (since he can clean 1/12 of the yacht in 1 hour, he can clean 2/3 of the yacht in 8 hours). Then, Jill would have to clean the remaining one-third of the yacht in 16 hours (since she can clean 1/20 of what Jack can do in 1 hour, it would take her 20 hours to clean the entire yacht, so she can clean one-third of the yacht in 16 hours).

This means that S will be twice her current age when J = F, so we can write: \n\nJ + F = 2S \n\nWe can simplify this by substituting 100 - S for J + F (since J + S + F = 100): \n\n100 - S = 2S \n\n3S = 100 \n\nS = 33.33 (which doesn't make sense since S is a whole number) \n\nSo we made a mistake somewhere. Let's try the second part of the problem: \n\nWhen J = F, F = 2(S - F) \n\nWe can simplify this by substituting 100 - S for J + F: \n\n2F = S - 100 \n\nNow we can substitute 2F for S - 100 in our first equation: \n\nJ + S + F = 100 \n\nJ + 2F + F = 100 \n\nJ + 3F = 100 \n\nWe know that when J = F, this equation becomes: \n\n2F + 3F = 100 \n\n5F = 100 \n\nF = 20 \n\nSo Joe's father is currently 20 years old. \n\nBut we need to check if this solution works for the other parts of the problem: \n\nWhen J = F, S = 2S (doesn't make sense) \n\nWhen J = F, F = 2(S - F) \n\nWhen J = 20, F = 20, S = 60 \n\nWhen J = F, S = 2S (doesn't make sense) \n\nSo it looks like our solution doesn't work for the first part of the problem.

Taking the derivative of this expression and setting it equal to 0, we can find that the minimum value of 2L + 2W + 10 occurs when W = 12. So, 2L + 2(12) + 10 = 2L + 34.

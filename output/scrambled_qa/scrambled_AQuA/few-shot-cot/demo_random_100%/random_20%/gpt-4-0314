In this time, the angle of elevation changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. Using the tangent function, we can write the following equations:\n\ntan(45\u00b0) = h / (x + h) and tan(60\u00b0) = h / x, where h is the height of the tower.\n\nSolving for h in the first equation, we get h = x. Substituting this into the second equation, we get tan(60\u00b0) = x / (x - x) = x / x.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = h / (tan(60\u00b0) - 1) = h / (\u221a3 - 1).\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for the car to travel this remaining distance. Since the car travels x in 10 minutes, it will travel h / (\u221a3 - 1) in 10 * (h / (\u221a3 - 1)) / x = 10(\u221a3 - 1) minutes.\n\nThe answer is (C) 7(\u221a3 - 1).", "pred_strict": "C", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "A"}

The sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula Sn = n/2 * (a1 + an), where Sn is the sum of the series, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. In this case, Sn = 250, a1 = 7, and the common difference d = 3/12 = 0.25 years. \n\nWe can find the last term an using the formula an = a1 + (n-1)d. Since we don't know n, we can rewrite this formula as an = 7 + (n-1)0.25. \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for an back into the sum formula: 250 = n/2 * (7 + 7 + (n-1)0.25). Simplifying, we get 250 = n/2 * (14 + 0.25n - 0.25). \n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get 500 = n(14.25 - 0.25n). Expanding, we get 500 = 14.25n - 0.25n^2. Rearranging, we get 0.25n^2 - 14.25n + 500 = 0. \n\nNow we can solve this quadratic equation for n. Using the quadratic formula, we get n = (14.25 \u00b1 sqrt(14.25^2 - 4(0.25)(500))) / (2 * 0.25). \n\nSolving, we get two possible values for n: n \u2248 20.03 and n \u2248 19.97. Since n must be an integer, we can round to the nearest integer, which is 20. \n\nSo there are 20 members in the club. The answer is (B).", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "C"}

A invested Rs.40,000 for 12 months, B invested Rs.60,000 for (12 - 2) = 10 months, and C invested Rs.120,000 for (12 - x) months. The ratio of their investments is 40,000 * 12 : 60,000 * 10 : 120,000 * (12 - x). Simplifying, we get 480,000 : 600,000 : 1,440,000 - 120,000x.\n\nSince C's share of the profit is Rs.150,000 out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, the ratio of C's share to the total profit is 150,000 / 375,000 = 2 / 5. Therefore, the ratio of C's investment to the total investment is also 2 / 5.\n\nSetting up the equation, we have (1,440,000 - 120,000x) / (480,000 + 600,000 + 1,440,000 - 120,000x) = 2 / 5.

Find the number.\nChoices: (A)368 (B)377 (C)288 (D)997 (E)112\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the three-digit number be $100a + 10b + c$. We are given that $a + b + c = 17$ and $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109$. We are also given that $100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a$. Simplifying this equation, we get $99a - 99c = 495$, or $a - c = 5$. \n\nNow we have a system of three equations with three variables:\n\\begin{align*}\na + b + c &= 17 \\\\\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 &= 109 \\\\\na - c &= 5\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express $c$ in terms of $a$ and $b$: $c = 17 - a - b$. Substituting this into the third equation, we get $a - (17 - a - b) = 5$, which simplifies to $2a + b = 22$. \n\nNow we can express $b$ in terms of $a$: $b = 22 - 2a$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $a^2 + (22 - 2a)^2 + (17 - a - (22 - 2a))^2 = 109$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $9a^2 - 102a + 289 = 109$. This simplifies to $9a^2 - 102a + 180 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(3a - 20)(3a - 9) = 0$. The possible values for $a$ are $20/3$ and $3$. Since $a$ must be an integer, we have $a = 3$. \n\nSubstituting this value of $a$ back into the equation for $b$, we get $b = 22 - 2(3) = 16$. Substituting the values of $a$ and $b$ into the equation for $c$, we get $c = 17 - 3 - 16 = -2$. Since $c$ must be a positive integer, there is no solution for this problem.

The height fo the room is:\nChoices: (A)2.6m (B)3.9m (C)4m (D)4.2m (E)4.4m\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the height of the room be 2x meters and the semi-perimeter be 5x meters. The area of the walls, excluding doors and windows, is 15 sq.m more than the cost of the paper, which is 260 / 2 = 130 sq.m. So the total area of the walls is 130 + 15 = 145 sq.m. Since the paper is 50 cm wide, the length of the paper needed is 145 / 0.5 = 290 meters. The cost of the paper per meter is Rs.2, so the total cost of the paper is 290 * 2 = Rs.580. Since the cost of the paper is Rs.260, we have 580 = 260 + 15x, which gives x = 20 / 15 = 4 / 3. Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 2 * 4 / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.6 meters.

At teh same time Bob starts from Y and esog towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his nirtioced and returns ot X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his noitcedri adn nutserr to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels ta 78kmph. By the time teyh meet for hte desnco time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X nda Y.\nChoices: (A)144km (B)72 km (C)126km (D)84 km (E)48km\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the distance between X and Y be D km. When they meet for the second time, the total distance covered by both of them is 2D km. Since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, we can write the equation: 78t = 54t + 48, where t is the time taken for them to meet for the second time. Solving for t, we get t = 4 hours. Now, we can find the distance covered by Allen in 4 hours: 54 * 4 = 216 km. Since Allen covers the distance between X and Y twice, the distance between X and Y is 216 / 2 = 108 km. However, this is not one of the given choices. \n\nLet's check if we made a mistake in our calculations. When they meet for the second time, the total distance covered by both of them is 2D km. Since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, we can write the equation: 78t = 54t + 48, where t is the time taken for them to meet for the second time. Solving for t, we get t = 4 hours. Now, we can find the distance covered by Allen in 4 hours: 54 * 4 = 216 km. Since Allen covers the distance between X and Y twice, the distance between X and Y is 216 / 2 = 108 km. \n\nIt seems that we made a mistake in our initial assumption that the total distance covered by both of them is 2D km. In fact, the total distance covered by both of them is 3D km because Allen covers the distance between X and Y twice, and Bob covers it once. So, we should write the equation as: 78t = 54t + 48 + 54t, where t is the time taken for them to meet for the second time. Solving for t, we get t = 3 hours. Now, we can find the distance covered by Allen in 3 hours: 54 * 3 = 162 km. Since Allen covers the distance between X and Y twice, the distance between X and Y is 162 / 2 = 81 km. The closest answer choice to this value is (D) 84 km.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "D", "GT": "E"}

The tunnel is 1 mile long, which is equivalent to 5280 feet. The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, so it has already traveled 3 * 176 = 528 feet. The remaining distance to travel is 5280 - 528 = 4752 feet. To travel this distance at 176 feet per second, it will take 4752 / 176 = 27 seconds. Adding the 3 seconds it took to enter the tunnel, the total time to pass completely through the tunnel is 27 + 3 = 30 seconds. However, this answer is not in the choices, so we must have made an error.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem. The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which means that the length of the train is 3 * 176 = 528 feet. The total distance the train must travel to pass completely through the tunnel is the length of the tunnel plus the length of the train, which is 5280 + 528 = 5808 feet.

If the merchant pays within 30 days, the net amount payable is $20,000 - $800 = $19,200. To find the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money, we can set up a proportion: (800 / 19,200) = (x / 100). Solving for x, we get x = 4.1667%. Since this is an annual rate, we need to find the equivalent monthly rate by dividing by 12: 4.1667% / 12 = 0.3472%.

In this case, L(x,y) = x + y + (x+y) = 2x + 2y, and R(x,y) = 2x + 2y, so L(x,y) = R(x,y).\n\nIf x and y are both non-integers, then [x] = x-1, [y] = y-1, [x+y] = x+y-1, [2x] = 2x-1, and [2y] = 2y-1. In this case, L(x,y) = (x-1) + (y-1) + (x+y-1) = 2x + 2y - 3, and R(x,y) = (2x-1) + (2y-1) = 2x + 2y - 2, so L(x,y) \u2260 R(x,y).\n\nIf one of x and y is an integer and the other is a non-integer, then without loss of generality, let x be an integer and y be a non-integer.

Since the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver, each metal has a volume of 112.5\u03c0/2 = 56.25\u03c0 mm^3. Let the weight of aluminum be A and the weight of silver be S.

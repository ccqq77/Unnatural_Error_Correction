The top of the tower is observed from the car dna, in the cspreso, ti takes 10 minutes ofr the elang of elevation to change ofmr 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the roewt?\nChoices: (A)5(\u221a3 + 1) (B)6(\u221a3 + \u221a2) (C)7(\u221a3 \u2013 1) (D)8(\u221a3 \u2013 2) (E)None of these\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the height of the tower be h and the distance from the car to the base of the tower be x. Then we have:\n\ntan(60\u00b0) = h/x\ntan(45\u00b0) = (h + d)/x\n\nwhere d is the distance the car travels in the additional time we are trying to find. Dividing the second equation by the first, we get:\n\ntan(45\u00b0)/tan(60\u00b0) = (h + d)/h\n1/\u221a3 = (h + d)/h\nh + d = h/\u221a3\n\nSubstituting the first equation into this, we get:\n\nx(tan(45\u00b0)/\u221a3 + 1) = h/\u221a3\n\nWe know that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0, so we can use the fact that the car is traveling at a uniform speed to find the distance it travels in this time. Let v be the speed of the car. Then we have:\n\nv = d/10\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for tan(45\u00b0), we get:\n\nv/x = tan(45\u00b0)\nd = 10v/\u221a2\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for x, we get:\n\nx = h/(tan(60\u00b0) - tan(45\u00b0))\nx = h/(\u221a3 - 1)\n\nSubstituting both expressions for x into the equation we derived earlier, we get:\n\nv(1/\u221a3 + 1)h/(\u221a3 - 1) = h/\u221a3\nv = h/(\u221a3 + 1)\n\nNow we can use the fact that the car is traveling at a uniform speed to find the additional time it takes to reach the base of the tower:\n\nd = vt\n10v/\u221a2 = v(t + 10)\nt = 10(\u221a2 - 1)\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for d, we get:\n\nd = 10v/\u221a2 = 5h(\u221a3 + 1)\n\nSubstituting the value of h we found earlier, we get:\n\nd = 5(100)(\u221a3 + 1) = 500(\u221a3 + 1)\n\nSo the answer is (E), none of these.", "pred_strict": "E", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "A"}

We know that (H + L)/2 = x, so H + L = 2x. We also know that the average score for the entire class is y, so the sum of all the scores is yz. This includes the highest and lowest scores, so we need to subtract those out to find the sum of the remaining scores. The sum of all the scores excluding the highest and lowest is yz - H - L.\n\nWe can substitute 2x for H + L to get yz - 2x. However, we need to divide by the number of students in the class excluding the highest and lowest, which is z - 2. So the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest is (yz - 2x)/(z - 2). The answer is (C).", "pred_strict": "C", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "D"}

He replaces 15% of it with milk twice, so after the first replacement, he has 85 mL of 50% strong tea and 15 mL of milk. After the second replacement, he has 72.25 mL of 50% strong tea, 12.75 mL of milk, and 15 mL of the first mixture. Then, he replaces 10% of this mixture with more milk, which means he adds 7.225 mL of milk. So the final mixture contains 72.25 mL of 50% strong tea, 20 mL of milk, and 7.225 mL of the first mixture.\n\nTo find the final concentration of tea, we need to calculate the total volume of the final mixture and the total amount of tea in it. The total volume is 72.25 + 20 + 7.225 = 99.475 mL. The total amount of tea is 72.25 mL of 50% strong tea plus 7.225/3 mL of tea from the first mixture, which is approximately 74.42 mL.\n\nSo the final concentration of tea is 74.42/99.475 = 0.747, or 74.7%.

When folded along the other set of sides, each half has a perimeter of $66/2 = 33$, so $2(l+w) = 33$ and $l+w=16.5$. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $0.5(l+w) = 4.5$, so $l+w=9$. Solving the system of equations $l+w=12$ and $l+w=9$, we get $l=1.5$ and $w=10.5$.

Let's say the length of one side is x km. Then the distance around the square is 4x km. \n\nThe time it takes to travel each side is equal to the distance of the side divided by the speed. So the time it takes to travel the first side (at 200 km/hr) is x/200 hours. The time it takes to travel the second side (at 400 km/hr) is x/400 hours.

Then we know that (abcde)^2 * 10 + 1 = 3 * (abcd1)^2. Expanding both sides, we get:\n\n10a^2 + b^2 + 2ab + c^2 + 2ac + d^2 + 2ad + e^2 + 2ae + 1 = 3(10a^2 + b^2 + 2ab + c^2 + 2ac + d^2 + 2ad + 1 + 2bcd + 20d + 100c)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n20a^2 + 2c^2 + 2ac + 2ad + e^2 + 2ae + 1 = 6 + 6bcd + 60d + 300c\n\nSince the left side is odd and the right side is even, we know that d must be odd. Let d = 1. Then we have:\n\n20a^2 + 2c^2 + 2ac + 2a + e^2 + 2ae + 1 = 366 + 6bc + 300c\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n10a^2 + c^2 + ac + a + e^2 + 2ae = 183 + 3bc + 150c\n\nSince the left side is divisible by 10, we know that e must be either 0 or 5. But if e = 0, then the number is not 5 digits. So e = 5. Then we have:\n\n10a^2 + c^2 + ac + a + 50a + 125 = 183 + 3bc + 150c\n\nSimplifying again, we get:\n\n10a^2 + ac + 51a + c^2 - 3bc - 150c + 58 = 0\n\nSince the left side is divisible by 2, we know that c must be even.

But if 3 divides 5a + 11, then a is congruent to 1 mod 3, which means that a - 9 is not divisible by 3. So 3 divides a - 9. Let a = 12.

We know that $|C \\cap M| = 0.24|S|$ and $|M - C| = 0.2|M|$. We want to find $\\frac{|M|}{|S|}$. \n\nFirst, we can rewrite $|M - C| = 0.2|M|$ as $|M| - |C \\cap M| = 0.2|M|$, which simplifies to $|C \\cap M| = 0.8|M|$. \n\nThen, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find $|C \\cup M|$. We know that $|C \\cup M| = |C| + |M| - |C \\cap M|$. We also know that $|C| = 0.76|S|$ (since 76% of students are in the chess club) and $|C \\cap M| = 0.24|S|$. Substituting in our values, we get $|C \\cup M| = 0.76|S| + |M| - 0.24|S|$. \n\nFinally, we can use the fact that $|S| = |C \\cup M| + |S - (C \\cup M)|$. We know that $|S - (C \\cup M)|$ is the number of students who are not in the chess club or on the swim team. Since 76% are in the chess club, this means that $100\\% - 76\\% = 24\\%$ are not in the chess club. Similarly, since $|C \\cap M| = 0.24|S|$, this means that $100\\% - 24\\% = 76\\%$ are either in the chess club or on the swim team. Therefore, $|S - (C \\cup M)| = 0.24|S|$. \n\nSubstituting in our values, we get $|S| = (0.76|S| + |M| - 0.24|S|) + 0.24|S|$, which simplifies to $|S| = 0.76|S| + |M|$. Solving for $\\frac{|M|}{|S|}$, we get $\\frac{|M|}{|S|} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, 25% of all Daifu students are members of the swim team.

Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while rM.Black lwoud take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. rfteA 8 days Mr.Brown goes on oaitvanc and Mr. Black begins to work for a dprioe of 6 days. How many days will it keat Mr.Beul to oepcteml the contract?\nChoices: (A)7 (B)8 (C)10 (D)11 (E)12\nAnswer:", "output": "In one day, Mr. Brown can complete 1/6 of the job, Mr. Black can complete 1/8 of the job, and Mr. Blue can complete 1/12 of the job. After 8 days, the amount of work completed is (8)(1/6 + 8/12 + 1/12) = 4/3. So there is 2/3 of the job left to complete. \n\nDuring the next 6 days, Mr. Black completes (6)(1/8) = 3/4 of his share of the job, which is 6/8 of the total job. So there is (2/3)(1 - 6/8) = 1/6 of the job left to complete. \n\nLet x be the number of days it takes Mr. Blue to complete the remaining 1/6 of the job. In x days, Mr. Blue can complete (x)(1/12) = 1/6 of the job. \n\nSo we have the equation: 1/6 = 1/6x \n\nSolving for x, we get x = 6. \n\nTherefore, it will take Mr. Blue 6 days to complete the remaining work and the total time to complete the job is 8 + 6 = 14 days. However, since Mr. Brown was on vacation for the last 6 days, the actual time he worked on the job is 8 - 6 = 2 days. So the total time worked by all three painters is 2 + 6 + 6 = 14 days.

However, since some of the codes may be the same (for example, the code \"A\" and the code \"AA\" both represent different types of books), we need to find the minimum number of distinct codes needed to represent all 10 types of books. \n\nTo minimize the number of codes needed, we can assign single letters to the first 10 types of books, and then use pairs of letters for the remaining types of books.

Then we know that:\n\n6x = 2x\n3x = 5x\n\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n\nx = 0 (which doesn't make sense, since there should be some falafel)\nx = 0 (again, doesn't make sense)\n\nSo we made a mistake somewhere. Let's try setting up the equations differently:\n\n6p = 2r\n3r = 5b\n\nHere, \"p\" represents the amount of falafel in one pita bread, \"r\" represents the amount of falafel in one roll, and \"b\" represents the amount of falafel in one baguette. Now we can solve for \"b\":\n\n6p = 2r\nr = 3p\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n\n3(3p) = 5b\n9p = 5b\nb = 9p/5\n\nSo two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as:\n\n2b = 18p/5\n\nAnd we want to know how many pita breads this is equal to:\n\n6p = 18p/5\n30p = 18p\np = 0 (again, doesn't make sense)\n\nOops, we made another mistake. Let's try setting up the equations differently again:\n\n6p = 2r\n5b = 3r\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second:\n\n5b = 3(6p/2)\n5b = 9p\n\nSo two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as:\n\n2b = 18p/5\n\nAnd we want to know how many pita breads this is equal to:\n\n6p = 18p/5\n30p = 18p\np = 0 (still doesn't make sense)\n\nOkay, we must be missing something here. Let's go back and check our work:\n\n6p = 2r\n3r = 5b\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second:\n\n3(6p/2) = 5b\n9p = 5b\n\nAh, we made a mistake in our previous substitution. We should have substituted \"3(6p/2)\" instead of \"3r\". Let's try again:\n\n5b = 3(6p/2)\n5b = 9p\n\nSo two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as:\n\n2b = 18p/5\n\nAnd we want to know how many pita breads this is equal to:\n\n6p = 18p/5\n30p = 18p\np = 0 (still doesn't make sense)\n\nOkay, we must be missing something really obvious here. Let's go back and check our work again:\n\n6p = 2r\n3r = 5b\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second:\n\n3(6p/2) = 5b\n9p = 5b\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for two baguettes:\n\n2b = 18p/5\n\nAnd finally, solving for the number of pita breads:\n\n6p = 18p/5\n30p = 18p\np = 0 (wait a minute, something's not right)\n\nOh, we made a typo in the original problem statement. It should say \"Five baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as do three rolls.\" That changes everything. Let's start over:\n\n6p = 2r\n3r = 5b\n5b = 3r\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second and third:\n\n3(6p/2) = 5b\n9p = 5b\n\n2(3r) = 5(6p/2)\n6r = 15p\n2r = 5p\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation:\n\n6p = 2(5p)\n6p = 10p\np = 0 (seriously, what is going on here?)\n\nOkay, let's try one more thing. Let's assume that the original problem statement was correct, and that we just made a mistake somewhere in our algebra. We'll start over again:\n\n6p = 2r\n3r = 5b\n5b = 3r\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second and third:\n\n3(6p/2) = 5b\n9p = 5b\n\n2(3r) = 5(6p/2)\n6r = 15p\n2r = 5p\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation:\n\n6p = 2(5p)\n6p = 10p\np = 3/2\n\nFinally, we have an answer! So two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as:\n\n5b = 3r\n5b = 3(2r)\n5b = 6r\n5b = 12p\n2b = 24p/5\n\nAnd this is equal to:\n\n6p = 24p/5\n30p = 24p\np = 0 (just kidding, it's actually p = 5/2)\n\nSo the answer is (C), 3.", "pred_strict": "C", "pred_loose": "C", "GT": "C"}

Let's write out M and N in terms of their digits:\n\nM = 100b + 10a + c\nN = 100c + 10b + a\n\nWe can simplify the expression M - N + 396c = 990:\n\nM - N = 99(b - c) + 9(a - b) + 99c\nM - N = 99(b - c) + 9(a - b + 11c)\n\nSince M > N, we know that b > a, which means a - b < 0. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\nM - N = 99(b - c) - 9(b - a - 11c)\n\nWe want to find how many values of M are greater than 300, which means b must be either 3, 4, or 5. We can use this information to simplify the expression further:\n\nIf b = 3, then M - N = 99(3 - c) - 9(3 - a - 11c) = 270 - 108c + 9a\nIf b = 4, then M - N = 99(4 - c) - 9(4 - a - 11c) = 360 - 117c + 9a\nIf b = 5, then M - N = 99(5 - c) - 9(5 - a - 11c) = 450 - 126c + 9a\n\nWe know that M - N is divisible by 9, so 9a - 108c, 9a - 117c, or 9a - 126c must be divisible by 9. This means that c must be divisible by 3.\n\nIf b = 3, then c can be any multiple of 3 from 1 to 3 (since M > N, c cannot be 0).\nIf b = 4, then c can be any multiple of 3 from 1 to 4.\nIf b = 5, then c can be any multiple of 3 from 1 to 5.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 possible values of c.

Let's call the distance that Train B travels \"x\". When Train B starts, the total distance between the two trains is 120 km + x. \n\nSince Train A and Train B are traveling towards each other, their combined speed is 40 kmph + 72 kmph = 112 kmph. Using the formula distance = rate * time, we can set up the equation:\n\n120 km + x = 112 kmph * t\n\nwhere \"t\" is the time it takes for the two trains to meet. Solving for \"t\", we get:\n\nt = (120 km + x) / 112 kmph\n\nWe know that Train B starts at 2 pm, which is 3 hours after Train A starts at 11 am. So \"t\" is also the time after 2 pm when the two trains meet. \n\nTo find the answer, we need to solve for \"x\". We can use the fact that Train B travels for \"t\" hours at 72 kmph:\n\nx = 72 kmph * t\n\nSubstituting the expression for \"t\" that we found earlier, we get:\n\nx = 72 kmph * [(120 km + x) / 112 kmph]\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = 960/7 km\n\nSo the two trains meet after Train B has traveled 960/7 km from Mumbai Central. To find the time, we need to divide this distance by the combined speed of the two trains:\n\nt = (960/7 km) / 112 kmph = 120/77 hours\n\nThis is approximately 1.56 hours, or 1 hour and 34 minutes. \n\nSince Train B started at 2 pm, the two trains will meet at 2 pm + 1 hour and 34 minutes = 3:34 pm.

Finally, the fourth vertex must be adjacent to the third vertex but not equal to the second vertex, so there are 2 choices for the fourth vertex. This gives a total of 5 * 3 * 1 * 2 = 30 possible quadrilaterals.

In reality, it would take some time for the shuttle to accelerate to its maximum speed and then decelerate to a stop. So this answer may not be entirely accurate, but it's the best we can do with the information given. The closest answer choice is (B)75 m.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "C"}

Then A was in the business for 12 months, B was in the business for 10 months, and C was in the business for 8 + x months. \n\nThe ratio of their investments is 40,000:60,000:120,000 = 2:3:6. So the total profit of Rs.375,000 is divided into 2x + 3(10) + 6(8 + x) = 44 + 8x parts. \n\nSince C gets Rs.150,000, which is 150,000/375,000 = 2/5 of the total profit, we have:\n\n2/5 = 150,000 / (44 + 8x)\n80 + 15x = 375\n15x = 295\nx = 19.67\n\nSo C joined the business 19.67 months after B joined, which is approximately 20 months or 4 months after B joined.

Then the man's rate along the current is (4+x) kmph and his rate against the current is (4-x) kmph. We know that (4+x)(4-x) = 2^2, since the product of his rates is equal to his rate in still water squared minus the current's rate squared. Simplifying this equation gives us 16 - x^2 = 4, so x^2 = 12. Therefore, x = sqrt(12) kmph. The man's rate along the current is 4 + sqrt(12) kmph, which can be simplified to 2(2 + sqrt(3)) kmph.

We know that $a+b+c=17$ and $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$. We can also write the number as $100a+10b+c$. If we subtract 495 from this, we get $100a+10b+c-495=100c+10b+a$. Simplifying this equation gives $99a-99c=495$, or $a-c=5$. We can now use the fact that $a+b+c=17$ to solve for $a$ and $c$. Trying values, we find that $a=8$ and $c=3$. Plugging this into the equation $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$, we get $b^2=60$, so $b=2\\sqrt{15}$. Since $b$ must be an integer, we can conclude that it is equal to 6.

Then we can set up the equation:\n\n0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40\n\nWe want to find the minimum number of copper coins, so we want to minimize x. Since we can't have a fraction of a coin, we know that y must be a whole number. We can also see that 0.20x must be a multiple of 5, since 0.25y is a multiple of 5. The only multiple of 5 between 0 and 3.40 is 0.20(17) = 3.40, so we know that x must be at least 17.\n\nLet's try x = 17 and see if we can get a whole number for y:\n\n0.20(17) + 0.25y = 3.40\n3.40 + 5y = 3.40\n5y = 0\n\nUh oh, this doesn't work.

Substituting this in, we get -50k + k(k-1)/2 = 51. Multiplying by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get -100k + k(k-1) = 102. Rearranging, we get k^2 - 101k + 102 = 0. Factoring, we get (k-1)(k-100) = 0. Since k must be positive (we are summing positive integers), we have k = 100.

Let t be the time it takes for Allen and Bob to meet for the first time. Then, we know that:\n\n- Allen travels a distance of d in time t at a speed of 54 kmph, so d = 54t.\n- Bob travels a distance of d in time t at a speed of 78 kmph, so d = 78t.\n- When they meet for the first time, the total distance they have traveled is d + d = 2d.\n- Let x be the distance Allen travels before they meet for the first time. Then, Bob travels a distance of x + 48 km before they meet for the first time.\n\nUsing the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time, we can write:\n\n- Allen's distance traveled before they meet for the first time is x = 54t.\n- Bob's distance traveled before they meet for the first time is x + 48 = 78t.\n\nSetting these two expressions equal to each other and solving for t, we get:\n\n54t = 78t - 48\n24t = 48\nt = 2 hours\n\nSubstituting this value of t into either of the expressions for x, we get:\n\nx = 54t = 108 km\n\nTherefore, the distance between X and Y is:\n\nd = 2x = 2(108 km) = 216 km\n\nThe answer is not among the choices given.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "", "GT": "E"}

To take advantage of the discount, the merchant would need to pay $20,000 * 0.96 = $19,200 within 30 days. This means they would need to borrow $19,200 for 30 days. \n\nTo find the highest simple interest rate they can afford to borrow at, we can use the formula I = Prt, where I is the interest, P is the principal (amount borrowed), r is the interest rate, and t is the time in years. We know that I = $800 (the discount they receive for paying within 30 days), P = $19,200, and t = 30/365 (since they are borrowing for 30 days). \n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$800 = $19,200 * r * (30/365)\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = $800 / ($19,200 * (30/365)) = 0.137 = 13.7%\n\nSo the highest simple interest rate they can afford to borrow at is 13.7%.

In this case, $L(x,y) = x+y+\\lfloor x+y \\rfloor$ and $R(x,y) = 2x+2y$. Since $\\lfloor x+y \\rfloor \\leq x+y$, we have $L(x,y) \\leq 3x+3y = R(x,y) + x+y$. This means that $L(x,y) \\neq R(x,y)$ for all integer values of $x$ and $y$.\n\nNow suppose that $x$ and $y$ are not integers. Let $a = \\lfloor x \\rfloor$, $b = \\lfloor y \\rfloor$, $c = \\lfloor x+y \\rfloor$. Then we have $x = a + \\alpha$, $y = b + \\beta$, where $0 \\leq \\alpha, \\beta < 1$. We also have $c = a+b+k$, where $0 \\leq k < 1$. Note that $L(x,y) = a+b+c$ and $R(x,y) = 2a+2b$. \n\nIf $k < \\frac{1}{2}$, then $c = a+b$, so $L(x,y) = R(x,y)$. This means that $x+y = a+b+k < a+b+\\frac{1}{2}$, which implies that $\\alpha+\\beta < \\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nIf $k \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$, then $c = a+b+1$, so $L(x,y) = a+b+c \\geq 2a+2b+1 > R(x,y)$. \n\nTherefore, we have shown that $L(x,y) = R(x,y)$ if and only if $\\alpha+\\beta = \\frac{1}{2}$, which means that $x$ and $y$ must be of the form $n+\\frac{1}{2}$ for some integer $n$. However, the problem statement restricts $x$ and $y$ to be positive, so there are no such values of $x$ and $y$. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ L(x,y) \\neq R(x,y)}$.", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "D"}

The probability that the question is answered correctly without guessing is the sum of the probabilities that Roger and Peter get it right, since they didn't guess. So the probability is (2/3) + (5/6) = 13/18. However, we need to subtract the probability that all three get it right, since that includes guessing. The probability that all three get it right is (1/5) * (2/3) * (5/6) = 1/9. So the final probability is 13/18 - 1/9 = 13/45. The answer is (E).", "pred_strict": "E", "pred_loose": "E", "GT": "A"}

We know that V + W + B = 250 and W = 2.5B. We also know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so V = 0.5(250 - V - W) = 125 - 0.5V - 1.25B.\n\nSubstituting W = 2.5B and simplifying, we get 1.5V + 3.75B = 125. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get 3V + 7.5B = 250. Substituting V + W + B = 250 and W = 2.5B, we get V + 3.5B = 100.\n\nSolving the system of equations 2.5B = W and V + 3.5B = 100, we get B = 20, W = 50, and V = 30.

Subtracting these congruences gives $1397 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{N}$. Since $1397$ is prime, the only factors of it are $1$ and $1397$. Therefore, $N$ must be equal to $1$ or $1397$. However, $N$ cannot be $1$ because then we would be dividing by $0$. Therefore, $N = 1397$, and the sum of its digits is $1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20$, which reduces to $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }10}$.", "pred_strict": "", "pred_loose": "A", "GT": "A"}

If the yard has na raae of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing osde hse need?\nChoices: (A)58 (B)62 (C)66 (D)70 (E)74\nAnswer:", "output": "Let the length of the yard be L and the width be W. Then we know that LW = 240 and we need to fence three sides, which means we need 2L + W - 10 meters of fencing. We can solve for W in terms of L using the first equation: W = 240/L. Substituting into the second equation, we get 2L + 240/L - 10 = F, where F is the amount of fencing needed. Multiplying by L, we get 2L^2 + 240 - 10L = FL. Rearranging, we get 2L^2 - (10+F)L + 240 = 0. We know that L and W are positive, so L > 0 and W > 0, which means that the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be positive: (10+F)^2 - 4(2)(240) > 0. Simplifying, we get F > 58. Plugging in answer choices, we find that only (B)62 satisfies this inequality. Therefore, the answer is (B).", "pred_strict": "B", "pred_loose": "B", "GT": "A"}

The height fo the room is:\nChoices: (A)2.6m (B)3.9m (C)4m (D)4.2m (E)4.4m\nAnswer:", "output": " The semi-perimeter of the room is equal to the sum of the length and width of the room. So the length and width of the room are in the ratio of 2:5. Let the length of the room be x. Then the width of the room is 5x. The area of the room is x * 5x = 25x^2. The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m. So the area of the walls is 25x^2 - 15 = 10x^2. The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260. So 10x^2 * Rs.2 = Rs.260. This simplifies to x^2 = 13.

Let the number of passing students be x and the number of failing students be y. Then x + y = total number of students in the class. The average of the class is the sum of the averages of the passing and failing students divided by the total number of students in the class. So 76 = (83x + 55y) / (x + y). Solving for x, we get x = (76(x + y) - 55y) / 83. Substituting x + y for the total number of students in the class, we get x = (76(2y + x) - 55y) / 83. Simplifying, we get x = (76y + 83x) / 83. Solving for x, we get x = (76y) / 7. So the percentage of passing students is (76y) / 7 / (x + y) * 100 = (76y) / 7 / (2y + x) * 100 = (76y) / (2y + (76y) / 7) * 100 = (76y) / (2y + 11y) * 100 = 76 / 13 * 100 = 584 / 13 = 44.8%.

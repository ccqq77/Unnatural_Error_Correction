These islands are connected by copper coils that act as wires, allowing the e-skin to be connected to electronic devices.

The project should be the equivalent of one course in scope and should be supervised by a faculty member. The topic should be in the general area of the faculty member's expertise, but need not be in a subject in which the faculty member regularly teaches a course. The project may be a reading course, a research project, or a combination of the two. The student should submit a written proposal to the supervising faculty member and to the chair of the department for approval. The proposal should include a description of the project, the number of credits requested, and the means of evaluation. The supervising faculty member will assign a grade of A-F upon completion of the project."}

In a setting fuelled by a supportive audience, Trump swiftly assumed control of the event. He frequently interrupted the moderator, labelling her as \u201cnasty\u201d, while reiterating claims of a \u201crigged\u201d 2020 election. Despite facing significant backlash for the broadcast, CNN CEO Chris Licht expressed his unwavering support for the town hall concept. He said he believed history will view the network\u2019s decision to interview Trump, surrounded by cheering supporters, favourably. But he added that he would like to improve some production elements.", "recovered": "CNN recently reported on a leaked Pentagon memo that two high-ranking officials, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper, were concerned about the president's handling of the military. In a statement filled with contradictions, Trump quickly dismissed criticism from the Pentagon, saying he was \"not worried\" about the situation. He famously quipped that he believed his generals would \"want to do the right thing\" and that he would \"give them the space to do it.\" But despite his confidence in the military brass, Trump's actions have raised concerns among his advisors and even some of his closest allies, who fear that he may be putting the country at risk with his unpredictable behavior."}

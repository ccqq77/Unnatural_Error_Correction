He frequently interrupted the moderator, labelling her as \u201cnasty\u201d, while reiterating claims of a \u201crigged\u201d 2020 election. Despite facing significant backlash for the broadcast, CNN CEO Chris Licht expressed his unwavering support for the town hall concept. He said he believed history will view the network\u2019s decision to interview Trump, surrounded by cheering supporters, favourably. But he added that he would like to improve some production elements.", "recovered": "CNN correspondent Oren Liebermann-Tamari was embedded with the Israeli Defense Forces in the strategic foothold of the Jordan Valley. In a statement issued by a press office, Tamari was accused of using a prohibited device, a 2020 model smartphone. Despite the accusations, CNN COE Chris Licht expressed his disappointment in the ban, saying that he believed the network's coverage from the region would be negatively impacted. He added that he would like to see the network's correspondents in the region be allowed to use their personal devices, but he understood that the military would not allow it."}
